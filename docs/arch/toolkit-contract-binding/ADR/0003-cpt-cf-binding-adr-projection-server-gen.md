## Context and Problem Statement

ADR-0001 introduced a two-layer architecture: a clean **base trait** (zero transport annotations)
and a **projection trait** (`*Rest`, `*Grpc`) that carries transport annotations and is processed
by `#[toolkit::rest_contract]`. The macro currently generates a REST client struct from the
projection. Two gaps remain unfixed.

**Gap 1 — no parity enforcement.** There is no compile-time guarantee that the projection trait
agrees with the base. A rename or new parameter on the base that is not propagated to the
projection silently creates a stale client — the old method signature is still compiled, the
mismatch is invisible until a runtime call fails.

Note that "parity" has two independent directions, and they are **not** equally desirable to
enforce:

* *No drift* — every projection method must exist on the base with the same signature. This is
  always wanted; a projection method that does not correspond to a base method is by definition a
  stale client.
* *Full coverage* — every base method must appear in the projection. This is **not** universally
  wanted. A projection is a transport surface, and an author may deliberately expose only part of
  the domain contract over REST. Enforcing it by default would be wrong.

The decision below closes the first direction unconditionally and makes the second opt-in. See
[Parity: what is enforced, and when](#parity-what-is-enforced-and-when).

**Gap 2 — two independent OpenAPI sources.** Server-side handler code (`routes.rs`,
`handlers.rs`) is written by hand against `OperationBuilder`, duplicating every path, HTTP verb,
and schema already declared in the projection. The macro generates an IR used for the client;
`OperationBuilder` is called separately for the server. The two are not structurally connected and
will drift.

This ADR decides how to close both gaps while keeping the two-layer design intact.

## Decision Drivers

* **Keep base trait clean** — the base trait is the domain interface; it must carry zero transport
  annotations. Authors and IDE users reading the base trait see only the domain contract.
* **Scale across multiple transports** — a contract may have both a REST and a gRPC projection;
  if annotations for all transports were placed on the base, every method would accumulate a stack
  of per-transport attributes. Each projection must remain a self-contained, transport-specific file.
* **Single OpenAPI source of truth** — the same IR that drives REST client generation must also
  drive server route generation; the two must share one definition and cannot diverge.
* **Parity enforced at compile time** — a method missing from the projection, or with a mismatched
  signature, must be caught at `cargo check`, not at runtime.
* **Zero migration cost** — existing projection traits must continue to compile unchanged; new
  features are additive.
* **Preserve the escape hatch** — ADR-0001 and ADR-0002 promise manual implementation as an
  opt-out; that promise is kept.
* **Preserve ADR-0002 scope** — the macro covers the same narrow REST subset; the annotation
  vocabulary grows only by the additions already anticipated in ADR-0002 § Phase 2.

## Considered Options

* **Option A**: Extend the `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` projection macro to (a) enforce method-set
  parity against the base at compile time and (b) additionally generate a server-side
  `register_<name>_routes()` function alongside the existing client struct.
* **Option B**: Collapse HTTP annotations onto the base trait; remove projection traits; a single
  `#[toolkit::contract]` macro generates client, server routes, and OpenAPI in one pass.
* **Option C**: Retain projection traits unchanged; commit an `openapi.json` per SDK crate; add a
  CI diff check that regenerates and compares it on every PR.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Option A — Extended projection macro.**

The `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` macro gains two new responsibilities while leaving the two-layer
design and the base trait untouched.

### 1. Compile-time base-projection parity check

The macro receives the projection trait token stream. It has access to the declared supertrait
bound (e.g., `: BillingApi`) and to the list of methods redeclared in the projection. It emits
a `const _` validation block that, for each method declared in the projection, verifies:

* The method name exists on the base trait (Rust enforces signature compatibility through the
  `: Base` supertrait; the macro's job is to catch the *coverage* direction).
* No extra methods exist in the projection that are absent from the base (those would generate
  unreachable client dispatch code).

A `#[rest_contract(require_full_coverage)]` opt-in causes the macro to also error when a method
exists on the base but is absent from the projection (i.e., no REST binding declared for it).
Without this flag the missing method is silently skipped (useful during incremental adoption).

### Parity: what is enforced, and when

As built, the no-drift direction is enforced by the **delegating default methods** the macro
installs on the projection trait, not by the separate `const _` blocks sketched above. Each
projection method's body becomes `<Self as Base>::method(self, args…).await`
(`projection.rs::build_delegation_body`), so name and signature agreement is checked by ordinary
name resolution and type checking when the projection trait itself compiles — no feature flag, no
test run.

| Property | How | When |
|---|---|---|
| Projection method exists on the base | `E0576` — the delegating body cannot resolve the name | always, at `cargo check` |
| Projection signature matches the base | `E0308` from the delegation call | always, at `cargo check` |
| Every base method has a REST binding | `E0046` on the generated client `impl` | only with `rest-client` |
| ↳ same, without `rest-client` | `validate_http_binding` against the base `Contract` IR | opt-in: `require_full_coverage` (a generated `#[test]`), or at startup via `#[toolkit::provides]` |
| Contract `version` matches the `base_path` version segment | `version_matches_base_path` | opt-in, same generated test |
| Duplicate `(verb, path)` in one projection | macro error | always |

The practical consequence: **partial projections are the default and compile fine.** A gear that
exposes three of its five contract methods over REST needs no flag and gets no warning. Only an
author who wants the stricter guarantee opts in.

### Reshaping and aggregation live above the projection

A projection method is a strict 1:1 delegation to a base method. Three properties make this
binding, and they are worth stating because they rule out a shape people reasonably expect:

* A projection method whose name is absent from the base fails with `E0576`.
* Every projection method must carry an HTTP verb attribute, so a non-transport helper cannot be
  declared on the projection at all.
* An author-written default body on a projection method is **discarded** — the parser reads it only
  as a presence flag and the macro overwrites it with the delegation.

So a method that combines two contract operations, renames one, or reshapes its arguments cannot be
a projection method. That is deliberate: such a method is not a wire operation, and it should not
appear in `HttpBindingIr`, the OpenAPI document, or the generated routes.

The place for it is **above** the generated client — an extension trait over the base contract:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait BillingApiExt: BillingApi {
    /// Convenience: charge, then fetch the resulting invoice.
    async fn charge_and_fetch(&self, ctx: SecurityContext, req: ChargeRequest)
        -> Result<Invoice, CanonicalError>
    {
        let resp = self.charge(ctx.clone(), req).await?;
        self.get_invoice(ctx, &resp.invoice_id).await
    }
}
impl<T: BillingApi + ?Sized> BillingApiExt for T {}
```

Because it is blanket-implemented over the base trait, it composes identically over the local
in-process impl, the generated REST client, and the directory-resolving client. It is also
invisible to `require_full_coverage`, so opting into strict coverage does not conflict with
shipping convenience APIs.

### 2. Server-side `register_<name>_routes()` generation

From the same IR pass that builds `HttpBindingIr` for the client, the macro additionally emits:

```rust
/// Register all `BillingApi` REST routes on the given router.
pub fn register_billing_api_routes(
    router: axum::Router,
    openapi: &dyn toolkit::openapi::OpenApiRegistry,
    service: std::sync::Arc<dyn BillingApi>,
) -> axum::Router { /* generated OperationBuilder calls */ }
```

This function is the drop-in replacement for the hand-written `routes.rs`. The same IR that
produces the client's URL template and method verb drives the `OperationBuilder` call sequence.

### Before / After

> Target state. The `#[rest(...)]` attributes below are not implemented yet;
> see [Implementation status (PoC)](#implementation-status-poc).

**Before (current state):**

```rust
// base trait — clean; zero annotations
#[toolkit::contract(module = "billing", version = "v1")]
pub trait BillingApi: Send + Sync {
    /// Charge a payment method.
    #[idempotency(NonIdempotentWrite)]
    async fn charge(
        &self, req: ChargeRequest, #[secctx] ctx: SecurityContext,
    ) -> Result<ChargeResponse, BillingError>;
}

// projection — generates client only; no parity check; no server routes
#[toolkit::rest_contract(base_path = "/billing/v1")]
pub trait BillingApiRest: BillingApi {
    #[post("/payments/charge")]
    async fn charge(
        &self, req: ChargeRequest, #[secctx] ctx: SecurityContext,
    ) -> Result<ChargeResponse, BillingError>;
}

// routes.rs — hand-written; independently duplicates path and schema
pub fn routes(service: Arc<dyn BillingApi>) -> Router {
    OperationBuilder::new()
        .post("/billing/v1/payments/charge")
        .summary("Charge a payment method")
        // ... 25 more lines, maintained manually
        .build(handler, service)
}
```

**After (extended projection):**

```rust
// base trait — UNCHANGED; still zero transport annotations
#[toolkit::contract(module = "billing", version = "v1")]
pub trait BillingApi: Send + Sync {
    /// Charge a payment method.
    #[idempotency(NonIdempotentWrite)]
    async fn charge(
        &self, req: ChargeRequest, #[secctx] ctx: SecurityContext,
    ) -> Result<ChargeResponse, BillingError>;
}

// projection — generates client AND register_billing_api_routes()
// compile error if method absent from base or signature mismatches
#[toolkit::rest_contract(base_path = "/billing/v1", require_full_coverage)]
pub trait BillingApiRest: BillingApi {
    /// Charge a payment method.
    /// Creates a new payment in `pending` status and returns its identifier.
    #[post("/payments/charge")]
    #[rest(status = 201, tag = "payments")]
    async fn charge(
        &self, req: ChargeRequest, #[secctx] ctx: SecurityContext,
    ) -> Result<ChargeResponse, BillingError>;
}

// routes.rs — DELETED; register_billing_api_routes() is now generated
```

### Metadata resolution for generated `OperationBuilder` calls

> Target state. Doc-comment→`summary`/`description`, `<module>.<method>`
> operation IDs, and the `#[rest(...)]` overrides in this table are deferred —
> see [Implementation status (PoC)](#implementation-status-poc) for what the
> macro resolves today.

| `OperationBuilder` field | Source (in priority order) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| `summary` | First line of the projection method's `///` doc-comment |
| `description` | Remaining lines of the projection method's `///` doc-comment |
| `operation_id` | `"<module>.<method_name>"` |
| `tag` | `#[rest(tag = "…")]`, or default `"<Module>"` |
| `.authenticated()` | Always emitted when a `#[secctx]` parameter is present |
| `.path_param(…)` | One call per `#[path]`-annotated parameter |
| `.query_param(…)` | One call per `#[query]`-annotated parameter (scalar / flat-struct) |
| Request body | `.json_request::<ReqType>()` when a Body binding exists |
| Success response | `.json_response_with_schema::<OkType>()`, overrideable with `#[rest(status = N)]` |
| Error responses | `.standard_errors()` always — mirrors `ContractError → Problem Details` |
| SSE response | `.sse_json::<ItemType>()` when `#[streaming]` is present |
| License | `.no_license_required()` default; `#[rest(license = "…")]` override |

Doc-comments on projection methods are optional. When absent the macro synthesizes a summary from
the method name (e.g., `charge` → `"Charge"`). Authors who want richer OpenAPI descriptions add
`///` lines to the projection method; these supplement, not replace, the base trait's doc-comments
which remain the canonical domain documentation.

### gRPC projection — unchanged, still additive

Adding gRPC means adding a separate `BillingApiGrpc` projection processed by
`#[toolkit::grpc_contract]`. Each projection is a self-contained file with only its own transport's
annotations. No method accumulates annotations from multiple transports in one place.

```rust
// grpc/mod.rs — independent from rest/mod.rs
#[toolkit::grpc_contract(package = "billing.v1")]
pub trait BillingApiGrpc: BillingApi {
    #[grpc(name = "ChargePayment")]   // optional; defaults to PascalCase of method name
    async fn charge(
        &self, req: ChargeRequest, #[secctx] ctx: SecurityContext,
    ) -> Result<ChargeResponse, BillingError>;
}
```

### Consequences

* The two-layer design from ADR-0001 is preserved and extended, not replaced. No migration
  required; existing projection traits compile unchanged.
* `register_<name>_routes()` is a new generated symbol; existing hand-written `routes.rs` files
  must be deleted or delegated to the generated function. The transition is per-SDK-crate and can
  be done incrementally.
* `require_full_coverage` is opt-in to allow incremental adoption; new SDK crates are expected to
  use it by default.
* The method-level annotation vocabulary grows by `#[path]`, `#[query]` (scalar / flat-struct),
  the bare marker `#[server_manual]`, and the value-carrying group `#[rest(status, tag, license)]`.
  These were already anticipated in ADR-0002 § Phase 2. The base trait annotation vocabulary is
  unchanged.
* `#[server_manual]` on a projection method excludes that method from `register_<name>_routes()`
  while keeping it in the client and the binding IR. The author writes a manual `OperationBuilder`
  call and composes it with the generated function.
* ADR-0002 scope is preserved: union bodies, `multipart/form-data` requests and general multipart
  document assembly, response headers, and per-status schemas still require a manual
  `impl Base for MyClient`; the macro does not gain new coverage. The one narrowing since is
  ADR-0002's own amendment: `multipart/mixed` **response streaming** — one JSON item per part,
  selected by `#[streaming(multipart_mixed)]` — is in scope for the *client* and the binding IR.
  Its server side is still hand-written, like SSE's.

#### Attribute shape: bare marker vs. `#[rest(...)]` group

A method annotation is **bare** (`#[streaming]`, `#[retryable]`, `#[server_manual]`) or lives inside
the value-carrying **`#[rest(...)]`** group (`#[rest(status = 201, tag = "Payments", license = "…")]`).
The rule for choosing:

* **Bare attribute** — a boolean, argument-less per-method *marker*: presence alone carries the full
  meaning, there is no value to attach. New boolean flags join `#[streaming]` / `#[retryable]` as bare
  attributes for consistency. `#[server_manual]` is one of these.
* **`#[rest(key = value, …)]`** — REST-projection *configuration that carries a value* (a status code,
  a tag string, a license scope). Grouping these under one attribute keeps the method signature quiet
  when several are set and namespaces them as projection config rather than contract semantics. A bare
  flag gains nothing from the group, so it stays out of it.

A marker may take an argument of its own without becoming `#[rest(...)]` config, where that argument
is *intrinsic to what the marker means* rather than orthogonal projection configuration:
`#[streaming(sse | multipart_mixed)]` selects the stream's wire framing, and a stream has no meaning
apart from a framing — which is why the framing parameterises `#[streaming]` instead of joining the
`#[rest(...)]` group, where it would read as an independently-settable knob that could be present
without a stream or absent with one.

Rationale: the existing `#[get("…")]` / `#[streaming]` / `#[retryable]` vocabulary already splits this
way (value-carrying verb vs. bare markers); the rule just makes the split explicit and forward-looking.
The attribute *name* is part of the SDK's public surface — moving a flag between bare and grouped form
later is a breaking change across every SDK crate — so the shape is fixed by this rule at introduction
time, not deferred. (An earlier draft of this ADR mis-filed `server_manual` inside the `#[rest(...)]`
group; the implemented form is the bare `#[server_manual]`, per this rule.)

### Implementation status (PoC)

A first PoC of the server-side generation has landed on `feature/toolkit_contracts`. What it
actually builds (the macro crate is `toolkit-contract-macros`, attribute `#[toolkit::rest_contract]`):

* **Generated symbol**: `register_<trait_snake>_routes(router, openapi, svc)` —
  e.g. `register_payment_api_rest_routes`. Signature
  `fn(axum::Router, &dyn toolkit::api::OpenApiRegistry, Arc<dyn Base>) -> axum::Router`,
  gated behind the SDK `rest-server` feature. Implemented in
  `libs/toolkit-contract-macros/src/rest_contract.rs::generate_server_registration`.
* **Per-method opt-out is a bare `#[server_manual]`** marker attribute, per the *Attribute shape*
  rule above (boolean markers are bare; the `#[rest(...)]` group is reserved for value-carrying
  config and is itself deferred). A method marked `#[server_manual]` is skipped by the generator but
  stays in the client and the binding IR. Parsed in `rest_contract_parse.rs` alongside `#[retryable]`
  / `#[streaming]`.
* **Manual `OperationBuilder` remains first-class and additive.** The generated function and a
  hand-written `OperationBuilder::verb(..).register(router, openapi)` chain share the identical
  `Router -> Router` shape and compose on one router with no global state. This is the explicit
  guarantee that the prior manual path (used across `file-parser`, `mini-chat`, etc.) is preserved,
  not replaced.
* **Unary handlers** are generated: `SecurityContext` via `Extension`, path params via `Path`, body
  via `Json` (first non-ctx/non-path param on POST/PUT), remaining params via `Query`. The handler
  calls `svc.method(ctx, ..).await.map(Json)`; the error type (`CanonicalError`) renders the RFC 9457
  `Problem` via its existing `IntoResponse`.
* **Streaming server-handler generation is deferred, for every framing.** A `#[streaming]` method
  that is *not* `#[server_manual]` raises a `compile_error!` directing the author to opt out and
  register it by hand. This is unchanged by the framing selector: `#[streaming(multipart_mixed)]`
  gets a generated *client* and binding IR, and its server side is registered by hand via
  `OperationBuilder::multipart_json` plus `toolkit::http::multipart::MultipartJsonStream`, exactly
  as SSE's is via `sse_json`. That is the intended shape until handler generation is picked up, not
  an interim measure. The `api-contracts` PoC marks its streaming methods `#[server_manual]` and
  keeps the hand-written routes.
* **PoC migration is hybrid**: `api-contracts` registers `charge` + `get_invoice` via the generated
  function and `list_payments` via a manual `register_manual_routes()` chained on the same router,
  composed by `register_routes()`.
* **`require_full_coverage` is implemented**, but as a generated `cargo test`-time assertion rather
  than the `cargo check`-time compile error this ADR originally proposed: the projection macro
  cannot see the base trait's method set at expansion time. `generate_full_coverage_check`
  (`rest_contract.rs`) emits a `#[test]` that runs `validate_http_binding` against the base
  `Contract` IR and also asserts the contract `version` matches the `base_path` version segment
  (ADR-0007 §3). The signature / no-extra-method direction *is* enforced at compile time and
  feature-independently — by the delegating default methods, rather than by the separate `const _`
  witness blocks the DESIGN sketched.
* **Not yet implemented** (follow-up): doc-comment → `summary`/`description` extraction,
  `#[rest(...)]` grouped attributes (`status`, `tag`, `license`), and streaming-handler generation
  (for SSE and `multipart/mixed` alike — the client and IR sides of both are done).
  `operation_id`/`tag` currently use a generated default (`<trait_snake>_<method>`) rather than
  `<module>.<method>`.

### Confirmation

* Unit tests: each projection annotation → `OperationBuilder` emission mapping covered by
  `cargo expand`-based macro expansion tests in `libs/toolkit-contract-macros/tests/`.
* Parity test: a projection method absent from the base fails to compile, naming the offending
  method — `E0576` from the delegating default body. Covered by the trybuild fixture
  `tests/ui/fail/rest_extra_projection_method.rs`; signature drift is covered by
  `rest_sig_drift_param_type.rs` (`E0308`).
* Coverage test: `require_full_coverage` on a projection that omits a base method fails, listing
  the uncovered method. This is a **generated `#[test]` that panics**, not a compile error — see
  [Implementation status](#implementation-status-poc) for why the macro cannot do it at
  `cargo check` time.
* Integration test: `register_billing_api_routes` for the `api-contracts` example produces an
  OpenAPI JSON fragment equal to the hand-written `routes.rs` fragment it replaces.
* Regression: all existing projection traits (`BillingApiRest` without `require_full_coverage`)
  continue to compile and produce an identical client struct to today's output.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option A: Extended Projection Macro (chosen)

Extend `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` to enforce parity and emit server routes from the same IR.

* Good, because base trait stays clean — zero transport annotations, unchanged from ADR-0001.
* Good, because each transport's projection is a self-contained file; adding gRPC does not add
  any annotations to the REST projection or to the base.
* Good, because zero migration cost — no existing code changes required; new capabilities are
  strictly additive.
* Good, because parity enforcement closes the silent-stale-client failure mode.
* Good, because server routes and OpenAPI spec derive from the same IR as the client — single
  source of truth.
* Neutral, because projection methods must still be redeclared (signatures duplicated from base).
  Mitigated: parity check turns signature drift from a silent bug into a loud compile error.

### Option B: Collapse Annotations onto Base Trait

HTTP annotations move onto the base trait. Projection traits are removed. One macro, one trait.

* Good, because each method is defined exactly once.
* Bad, because the base trait accumulates annotations from all transports in use. A REST + gRPC
  contract results in HTTP path attributes, gRPC name overrides, `#[path]`/`#[query]` inline on
  parameters, and `#[rest(…)]` overrides all on the same method — the trait becomes a transport
  configuration file, not a domain interface.
* Bad, because the annotation stack grows with each transport added; REST-only contracts start
  clean but are one gRPC addition away from becoming noisy.
* Bad, because migration requires rewriting every existing projection trait in the repository.
* Neutral, because the base trait emitted to consumers is clean (annotations stripped at expansion
  time), but authors reading the source see the full annotation stack.

### Option C: Retain Projection Traits + CI OpenAPI Diff

Commit `openapi.json` per SDK crate; CI regenerates and diffs on every PR.

* Good, because no code changes required.
* Good, because drift is caught in CI.
* Bad, because the root causes (no parity check, two independent OpenAPI generators) are not fixed.
* Bad, because committed `openapi.json` files become noisy regeneration artifacts on every method
  change.
* Bad, because two separate OpenAPI generators persist; CI enforces agreement but does not
  eliminate the duplication.

## More Information

  [`0001-cpt-cf-binding-adr-contract-source-of-truth.md`](./0001-cpt-cf-binding-adr-contract-source-of-truth.md)
  — two-layer design is preserved; this ADR extends the projection macro's responsibilities.
* ADR-0002 — OpenAPI spec limits:
  [`0002-cpt-cf-binding-adr-openapi-spec-limits.md`](./0002-cpt-cf-binding-adr-openapi-spec-limits.md)
