# Technical Design — Throttling Follow-Up: Config-Owned Keys, a Real `max_keys` Bound, and OpenAPI Extension Recovery

Status: draft, pending review
Authorizing decisions: [ADR-0002](ADR/0002-throttling-model-config-boundary-and-portability.md), [ADR-0001](ADR/0001-distributed-throttling-cluster-cache.md)
Supersedes nothing. Scoped follow-up to the zone-based throttling middleware.

**On placement.** These documents live under `docs/arch/`, alongside
`docs/arch/errors/`, `docs/arch/authorization/` and `docs/arch/toolkit-*`, and
are *not* Constructor Studio SDLC artifacts. `.cf-studio/config/artifacts.toml`
registers artifacts only under `gears/$system/docs`, `gears/system/$system/docs`
and `gears/bss/$system/docs`; nothing under `docs/arch/**` or `docs/adrs/**` is
in the registry (`cfs validate --artifact` reports *not in registry* for every
path in both trees, including the pre-existing ones). Registering them would mean
SDLC-documenting the api-gateway gear as a whole: `gears/system/api-gateway/*` is
currently listed in `[[ignore]]` as "not SDLC-documented yet: missing required
PRD/DESIGN", `PRD.md` is `required = true` at that scope, and `traceability` is
`FULL`. That is a separate undertaking, deliberately not bundled here.

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

ADR-0002 chose Option A — a declarative, config-owned throttling policy with a
runtime-agnostic contract. That ADR deliberately records intent only and defers
concrete types, config schema, and migration to a follow-up design. This is that
follow-up, narrowed to the three items that are defects in the shipped code
rather than shape improvements:

1. **The contract layer must not depend on a runtime.** `ThrottlingSpec` stores
   `IdentityKeyFn = Arc<dyn Fn(&axum::extract::Request) -> String>`, which pulls
   `axum` into `libs/toolkit`'s contract surface. ADR-0002 states removing this
   is a hard requirement.
2. **`max_keys` must bound something.** `RateLimitZone.max_keys` is parsed,
   validated (`> 0`) and documented as a key-count bound, but no code path reads
   it. Rate-zone memory is bounded only by a 10-second recency sweep.
3. **The OpenAPI throttling extensions must survive the zone model.** The
   throttling commit removed the `x-rate-limit-*` vendor-extension emission
   together with its only test, silently breaking spec consumers (W3).

The end state: a throttling zone is fully described by configuration. Code binds
an operation to a zone by name and nothing else. The key strategy is data the
gateway compiles into extraction logic, which is the precondition for ever
emitting a zone to an external gateway (Kong / Envoy / AWS API Gateway).

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

* **Runtime-agnostic contract** — `libs/toolkit` contract types must not name
  `axum` or any other runtime. Hard requirement on `feature/toolkit_contracts`.
* **Honest configuration** — a setting the operator can write, that the loader
  validates, must have an effect. A validated-but-ignored knob is worse than an
  absent one: it reports a protection that does not exist.
* **Bounded memory under hostile input** — pre-auth zones are keyed by client IP,
  which is attacker-influenced. The key set must be bounded by a value the
  operator controls, not only by arrival rate.
* **No behavioral change for current users** — the single in-tree consumer of
  `with_throttling` passes `identity_key_func: None`. Whatever replaces the
  closure must keep that path byte-identical.
* **Minimum surface** — no new public type is introduced for a capability that
  has no consumer.

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

* **Delete before you abstract.** The axum leak exists to support a
  customization point with zero consumers. Removing the customization point
  removes the leak without introducing a replacement type.
* **A knob means an invariant.** Every field the config loader validates must
  map to a runtime check. If no such check is practical, the field is removed
  rather than documented away.
* **The reviewer's stated property is the requirement**, not the shortest remedy
  they happened to list. `max_keys` is closed when the tracked key count cannot
  exceed the configured value — not when a periodic sweep exists.

### 2.2 Constraints

* `libs/toolkit` must not gain a dependency on the api-gateway gear; the current
  closure indirection exists to avoid that cycle. Moving the key strategy into
  gateway config dissolves the cycle instead of routing around it.
* `KeyType::Identity` requires an authenticated request. Config validation
  already rejects identity-keyed zones referenced from pre-auth operations
  (`require_security_context = false`); that rule is unchanged.
* Zones are shared across the pre-auth and post-auth partitions by one `Arc`
  each (`build_maps`); any key accounting added must be per-zone, not per
  partition, or the bound doubles.
* The distributed backend (ADR-0001) will replace per-key state entirely for
  rate zones. Whatever accounting is added here must be cheap to delete.

## 3. Key Decisions

### D1: Remove the closure rather than replace it with `enum Key`

ADR-0002 proposes replacing `IdentityKeyFn` with a serializable
`enum Key { Ip, Header(String), JwtClaim(String), … }`. This design does **not**
introduce that enum now.

Rationale: the key strategy already exists as data, in the zone config, as
`KeyType { Identity, Ip }`. The closure is an *override* of how the `Identity`
variant is extracted. A survey of the tree found no consumer of that override —
the only non-test caller (`gears/mini-chat/.../routes/chats.rs`) passes `None`,
and the `None` branch resolves the subject id from `SecurityContext`. Introducing
`enum Key` in the contract would therefore add a public type, a config schema
change, and a compile step for a capability nothing requests.

Removing the closure achieves ADR-0002's stated hard requirement — no `axum` in
the contract layer — with strictly less surface than adding the enum. Extra
variants (`Header`, `JwtClaim`) remain available later as a backward-compatible
addition to the existing `KeyConfig`, driven by a real requirement.

**Consequence:** `ThrottlingSpec` becomes a plain data struct — derivable
`Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, and serializable if needed — which is the actual
portability property ADR-0002 is after.

### D2: `KeyType` stays `{ Identity, Ip }` and stays in gateway config

The zone owns the key strategy. An operation names a zone; it does not describe
how that zone keys. This is the config/code boundary ADR-0002 asks for, applied
to keying.

`Identity` resolves to `SecurityContext::subject_id()`. A missing context is an
invariant violation, not a shared bucket: the request fails with an internal
error. `Ip` resolves through `client_ip()` with `trusted_proxy_hops`, unchanged.

### D3: `max_keys` becomes an enforced bound on rate zones

The reviewer's requirement is that the tracked key count cannot exceed the
configured limit. The current implementation prunes by recency every 10 seconds
(`retain_recent()` + `shrink_to_fit()`), which bounds staleness, not count.
Between ticks the key set grows with the arrival rate of distinct keys, which for
a pre-auth IP zone is attacker-influenced.

Note precisely what did and did not change since the review. The neighbouring
finding — an all-shard `DashMap::retain` on the request hot path — was addressed
by moving pruning to a background sweep. `get_or_build_rate_zone`, the function
the reviewer named, is unchanged: it reads `rate_limit.rps` and `burst_limit`,
stores the zone config wholesale (`cfg: cfg.clone()`), and never consults
`max_keys`. Both `cfg.max_keys` references in the middleware belong to the
in-flight gate. The rate-zone half of that review comment is open, not partially
closed.

`governor` 0.10.4's *public `RateLimiter` API* cannot enforce this — it exposes
`len()` but neither per-key removal nor a key-presence test. One level down the
crate does provide the lever: the `StateStore` trait is public and pluggable,
and a custom bounded store is feasible (see §3.2's rejected alternatives). The
chosen bound is instead a small admission structure owned by the gateway; the
mechanism, its costs, and why the custom store was rejected are in §3.2.

### D4: `max_keys` on in-flight zones is enforced on admission too

The in-flight gate originally read `max_keys` only in the sweep
(`prune_idle_keys` skips the scan below the cap and evicts unreferenced gates
above it). That left the gate map unbounded *between* sweeps: a pre-auth
IP-keyed in-flight zone could be grown by attacker-supplied key cardinality
exactly as rate zones could before W2. `InFlightZone::gate` now applies the
same admission contract as `RateZone::admit`: a never-seen key past the cap is
refused (`kind = "max_keys"`, `Retry-After` = prune interval) before a gate is
created, dry-run logs and serves without a gate, and the sweep reopens
admission. What remains different from rate zones is eviction only: a gate
held by a live request is never evicted, so a cap filled by live requests
stays closed until they finish.

Both zone kinds keep the tracked-key count in an atomic counter next to the
keyed structure, so the hot-path cap check never walks every `DashMap` shard.

## 3.1 Work Item W1 — Remove the runtime dependency from the contract

**Removals**

| Symbol | Location |
|---|---|
| `IdentityKeyFn` type alias | `libs/toolkit/src/api/operation_builder.rs` |
| `ThrottlingSpec::identity_key_func` field | `libs/toolkit/src/api/operation_builder.rs` |
| manual `impl Debug for ThrottlingSpec` | `libs/toolkit/src/api/operation_builder.rs` |
| `trait IdentityExtractor` | `gears/system/api-gateway/src/middleware/throttling.rs` |
| `fn identity_key_fn` adapter | `gears/system/api-gateway/src/middleware/throttling.rs` |

**Changes**

* `ThrottlingSpec` gains `#[derive(Debug)]` (and `PartialEq`, if no field
  blocks it) now that no `dyn Fn` field remains.
* `compute_key` loses its `map_or_else` over the extractor; `KeyType::Identity`
  resolves `SecurityContext` directly.
* `libs/toolkit/src/api/operation_builder.rs` drops its `axum::extract::Request`
  usage in the contract type. Verify no other contract-layer symbol reintroduces
  it before claiming ADR-0002's requirement closed.

**Call sites to update**

* `gears/mini-chat/mini-chat/src/api/rest/routes/chats.rs` — drop the
  `identity_key_func: None` field from the struct literal. No behavior change.
* Tests referencing the extractor: `builder_with_throttling_sets_spec_and_extractor`
  (toolkit), `compute_key_identity_uses_extractor_then_subject`,
  `StaticIdentity` and the `thr(…)` helper (gateway).

**Test consequences**

`compute_key_identity_uses_extractor_then_subject` currently asserts the
extractor is preferred over the subject id. With the extractor gone, the
remaining behavior — identity resolves to `subject_id()`, and `compute_key`
returns `None` when no `SecurityContext` is present — must still be asserted;
rename accordingly rather than delete. `builder_with_throttling_sets_spec_and_extractor` loses its reason
to exist in its current form; what survives is a `Debug`/`Clone` round-trip on a
now-plain struct, which is low value — prefer deleting it over keeping a test
that asserts derive macros work.

**Acceptance**

* `rg 'axum' libs/toolkit/src/api/operation_builder.rs` returns nothing in the
  contract types (imports for handler plumbing elsewhere in the file are out of
  scope and must be judged individually, not by grep alone).
* `cargo test -p cf-gears-toolkit -p cf-gears-api-gateway` green.
* No config schema change; existing YAML keeps working untouched.

## 3.2 Work Item W2 — Make `max_keys` bound the rate-zone key set

**Verified capability of `governor` 0.10.4** (pinned via workspace `governor = "0.10"`),
from `src/state/keyed.rs`:

| Primitive | Available | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `RateLimiter::len()` | yes | bounded on `S: ShrinkableKeyedStateStore<K>`; documented as possibly an estimate or out of date |
| `RateLimiter::is_empty()` | yes | same caveat |
| `retain_recent()` | yes | bulk; drops only keys whose state is indistinguishable from fresh |
| `shrink_to_fit()` | yes | capacity only |
| per-key removal | **no** | no `remove`, no eviction by key |
| key-presence test | **no** | no `contains_key` on the keyed API |

The table describes the public `RateLimiter` API: at that level there is no
containment test and no per-key removal, so the limiter cannot be bounded from
the outside. It does **not** follow that `governor` cannot be bounded at all —
the `StateStore` trait is a public extension point (`RateLimiter::new(quota,
state, clock)` is public, `KeyedStateStore` is blanket-implemented for any
`StateStore<Key = K>`, and `measure_and_replace`'s closure receives
`Option<Nanos>`, which is `None` exactly when a key is new). A custom bounded
store is therefore possible; it is considered and rejected below.

**Chosen mechanism — bounded admission set owned by `RateZone`.**
This is the reviewer's second suggested remedy ("a bounded keyed store").

* `RateZone` gains a key set (a `DashMap<String, ()>` or equivalent) capped at
  `max_keys`.
* On each request the middleware consults the set first. A key already present
  proceeds to `check_key` unchanged. A key not present is admitted only while
  the set is below `max_keys`; the insertion is what accounts for the key.
* When the set is full, an unknown key is rejected with the zone's configured
  status **without** reaching `check_key`, so `governor`'s internal map cannot
  grow past the admitted set.
* Unadmitted keys never reach `check_key` in **any** mode: enforce mode rejects
  them, dry-run mode counts and logs the would-be rejection and serves the request without
  consulting the limiter. Feeding unadmitted dry-run keys to the limiter would
  create keyed-store state past the cap, unbounding memory exactly in the mode
  operators use for tuning.
* The background sweep clears the admission set in the same tick it calls
  `retain_recent()` / `shrink_to_fit()`. Clearing rather than selectively
  pruning is deliberate: without a containment test on `governor`'s side there
  is no way to prune the two structures in agreement, and a full clear is
  self-correcting — over the zone's replenish window, not within a single
  interval. The residual desynchronization, bounded: a key that survives
  `retain_recent()` but is not re-admitted receives no further `check_key`
  calls, so its GCRA state replenishes untouched and becomes
  indistinguishable-from-fresh after the replenish window
  `W = (burst_limit + 1) / rps` seconds (worst-case stored arrival time is
  `last_hit + t·(burst_limit − 1) + t` with `t = 1/rps`, and `retain_recent`
  drops the key once `now ≥ TAT + t`); the first sweep after that drops it.
  Steady-state limiter size is therefore bounded by
  `max_keys × (1 + ⌈W / T⌉)` with `T` the prune interval (10 s) — the
  currently admitted cohort plus up to `⌈W/T⌉` dying cohorts of previous
  intervals. For zones whose replenish window fits one interval this is the
  familiar 2×; a zone with a large `burst_limit / rps` ratio pays
  proportionally more. Eliminating the factor entirely requires the
  custom-`StateStore` variant below, where admission and eviction live in one
  structure by construction.

Cost: one extra hash lookup on the throttling path, and a duplicated copy of the
key string per tracked key. The duplication is the price of a bound that
`governor` cannot provide; peak memory becomes `O(max_keys)` in the admission
set and `O(max_keys × (1 + ⌈W/T⌉))` in the limiter — zone-config-dependent, but
no longer unbounded in either.

**Rejected alternatives**

* *Custom bounded `StateStore` plugged into `governor`* — a `DashMap`-backed
  store implementing `StateStore` + `ShrinkableKeyedStateStore` with a hard cap
  at insertion and staleness-based eviction (sample-K over the stored `Nanos`).
  Strictly stronger than the admission set: exact bound, no second copy of the
  key, no extra hot-path lookup, and graceful eviction of the stalest key
  instead of rejecting new clients. Rejected for this PR because
  `InMemoryState`'s CAS methods are `pub(crate)`, so the store must hand-write
  its own `compare_exchange_weak` loop over `AtomicU64` — bespoke lock-free
  concurrency plus semantic coupling to GCRA state encoding is a
  review-and-maintenance burden out of proportion to a follow-up PR. Recorded
  here as the natural upgrade path if admission-set behavior under saturation
  proves problematic in production.
* *Adaptive sweep only* — shorten the prune interval as `len()` approaches
  `max_keys`. Cheap, never rejects a legitimate client, requires no second
  structure. Rejected as the primary mechanism because it bounds the key set by
  `arrival_rate × interval`, not by `max_keys`; it is a better sweep, not a
  bound, and does not satisfy the stated requirement. Worth adding alongside the
  admission set as a second-order improvement.
* *Reject all traffic on a saturated zone* — avoids needing a containment test
  by rejecting every request while `len() >= max_keys`. Rejected: it converts a
  key-cardinality attack into a full outage for that zone, which is a worse
  failure than the one being fixed.

**Additional requirements**

* Saturation must be observable: capacity rejections go through the existing
  `record_rejection` path (counter + `info` log with low-cardinality `zone`
  attributes) with a distinguishing `kind = "max_keys"`, so an operator can
  tell a real rate rejection from a capacity rejection. ADR-0001 already
  anticipates a reason label on this counter; this is a compatible shape.
  The bucket key (a client IP or a subject UUID, i.e. personal data) is a
  structured log field, never message text or a metric attribute, so a log
  pipeline can redact it or shorten its retention; the request id comes from
  the enclosing `http_request` span.
* Capacity rejections carry `Retry-After` equal to the prune interval — the
  upper bound on how long admission stays closed.
* Accounting is per zone (`Arc<RateZone>`), shared across both auth partitions,
  consistent with `shared_zone_arc_across_partitions`.
* Tests: admission refuses a new key beyond `max_keys` while admitted keys keep
  flowing, and admission reopens after the sweep resets the set (unit +
  end-to-end through the middleware).
* **The requirement is an approximate memory cap, not an exact count** (this
  supersedes any reading of "never exceeds `max_keys`" as an exact invariant;
  acceptance tests assert admission behavior and the dry-run bound, not an
  exact count). Two tolerated deviations, both bounded: the unsynchronized
  check-then-insert can overshoot by at most the number of
  concurrently-admitting requests, and the sweep's admission reset while the
  limiter retains still-replenishing keys bounds limiter state by
  `max_keys × (1 + ⌈W / T⌉)` with `W = (burst_limit + 1) / rps` and `T` the
  prune interval (see the sweep bullet above for the derivation). Unadmitted
  keys never reach the
  limiter in any mode — enforce rejects them, dry-run logs and serves without
  consulting it — so neither mode grows the keyed store past the cap between
  sweeps. Making the cap exact would require locking the hot path (or the
  custom `StateStore` below); not worth it for a memory bound.

**Alternative considered and rejected: remove the field.** Deleting `max_keys`
from `RateLimitZone` and documenting recency pruning as the only bound is
cheaper and honest. It is rejected because it removes the operator's only lever
against key-cardinality exhaustion on precisely the zones that face untrusted
input, and because it is a breaking config-schema change for a field already
shipped in example configs (`max_keys: 50000`).

## 3.3 Work Item W3 — Restore throttling OpenAPI vendor extensions

`main` emitted `x-rate-limit-rps` / `x-rate-limit-burst` on throttled
operations from `openapi_registry.rs`. The zone model removed both the emission
and its only test in the same commit, so the regression was invisible to CI.
The numbers now live in `ApiGatewayConfig`, which the contract layer must not
see (ADR-0002) — but `ApiGatewayGear::build_openapi()` has the config in scope.

**Mechanism — layered enrichment, zone name as the join key.**

* *Toolkit* (`openapi_registry.rs`): operations with a `ThrottlingSpec` gain
  `x-throttling-rate-limit-zone` / `x-throttling-in-flight-limit-zone` vendor
  extensions carrying the zone names — the only throttling facts the contract
  layer owns.
* *Gateway* (`gear.rs::build_openapi`): after the registry builds the document,
  a post-pass reads `x-throttling-rate-limit-zone` from each operation, looks
  the zone up in `config.rate_limit_zones`, and adds `x-rate-limit-rps` /
  `x-rate-limit-burst` — restoring `main`'s contract verbatim. The zone name is
  the join key, so no route-matching logic is duplicated; an unknown zone name
  is skipped silently (zone-reference validation already fails the router
  build).

Each layer emits only what it knows: the contract emits the binding, the
gateway emits the numbers. The ADR-0002 boundary is untouched from both sides.

**Tests**: toolkit — zone names emitted, absent without a `ThrottlingSpec`;
gateway — numbers added by zone name, unknown zone and unthrottled operations
untouched.

## 4. Out of Scope

Recorded so the boundary is explicit rather than implied by omission.

| Item | Why deferred | Tracked by |
|---|---|---|
| `x-in-flight-limit` numeric extension | W3 restores the rate-limit numbers `main` published; `main` never emitted in-flight numbers and no consumer is known. The zone-name binding (`x-throttling-in-flight-limit-zone`) is emitted; numbers can be added by the same gateway post-pass when a consumer appears | W3 |
| Per-replica limit multiplication | In-process state means a configured `N/s` admits `N × replicas`. Requires the cluster-cache backend | ADR-0001 |
| `dry_run` and `operation → zone` binding moving into config | Operator-facing ergonomics, not a defect; part of ADR-0002 Option A | ADR-0002 §Decision Outcome 1 |
| `tower::Layer` composition and group-level zones | Restructures enforcement; independent of the two defects here | ADR-0002 §Decision Outcome 3 |
| `enum Key` with `Header` / `JwtClaim` variants | No consumer; additive to `KeyConfig` when one appears | D1 |
| In-flight limiter distribution | Different problem (live lease, closer to a distributed lock) | ADR-0001 §Scope |

## 5. Risks / Trade-offs

### [Risk] The admission bound penalizes new keys under saturation

Once a zone's admission set is full, a legitimate new client is rejected with
`kind = "max_keys"` even though it has not exceeded any per-client limit, while
an established abuser already inside the set continues at its configured rate.
This applies to both zone kinds. It is inherent to any hard count bound — the
alternative is admitting unbounded keys — and is why the bound must be
observable and the default `max_keys` generous. Document the interaction; do
not silently ship it.

The full-clear on each sweep bounds how long a client stays locked out to one
prune interval. An established client loses its *admission*, not its limiter
state: `retain_recent` keeps active keys' GCRA state across the sweep, and the
state fades only over the replenish window when re-admission fails. Under
sustained saturation this makes admission roughly round-robin by arrival rather
than stable per client. Accept it as the cost of a hard bound, or revisit if a
zone in production shows churn.

### [Risk] Proxy-header trust is a deployment contract, not a runtime check

With `trusted_proxy_hops >= 1` the gateway derives the client IP from
`X-Forwarded-For` by position, with `X-Real-IP` as the fallback under the same
trust assumption, and never verifies that the immediate peer is a trusted
proxy. A gateway that is reachable directly therefore lets a client choose or
rotate its IP throttling key. The requirement is documented on
`trusted_proxy_hops`: only trusted proxies may reach the gateway, and they must
sanitize forwarding headers. Validating the peer against a configured proxy
list is a roadmap item.

### [Decision] A zone is all dry-run or all enforced

Zone state is shared by name, so a dry-run operation would spend the rate
tokens and in-flight permits of an enforced operation on the same zone and
cause enforced rejections. `build_maps` refuses a zone bound with both
`dry_run` values at startup. Isolating observational state from enforced
budgets needs a design and is a roadmap item.

### [Risk] `max_keys` semantics differ between zone kinds

After this work, `max_keys` caps admission on both zone kinds, but eviction
differs: rate zones reset admission wholesale every sweep, in-flight zones
evict only gates not held by a live request. The residual difference is stated
in both zone structs' doc comments (see D4); renaming the field would be a
config-schema break and is not proposed here.

### [Trade-off] Removing the extractor closes an extension point

A gear that genuinely needs custom identity extraction now has no path until
`KeyConfig` grows a variant. Accepted: there is no such gear, and the config
route is the one ADR-0002 wants. Reopening it means adding data variants, not
restoring a closure.

### [Constraint] W2 must be cheap to delete

ADR-0001's distributed backend replaces per-key state for rate zones outright.
Any accounting introduced by W2 should live in `RateZone` behind the same seam
the distributed backend will replace, so it does not become an obstacle to that
work.
