"""Bundles, overlays, and the preconditions the lifecycle verbs actually enforce.

These sit beside :mod:`test_pricing_seams`, which owns the plan and publish path.
Everything here is a surface that module does not reach, and every case was
written because building a client against these routes surfaced a fact the
contract did not state — or stated somewhere a caller does not read.

# What a caller cannot learn from `openapi.json`

Three of the assertions below exist because the published document is silent or
wrong about the request:

* ``POST /bundles/{bundleId}/publish`` declares **no request body** while the
  handler reads ``PublishBundleRequest { plan_revision, markets }``. A caller
  that believes the document sends nothing and is refused for a missing field.
* ``POST /bundles`` and ``PATCH /bundles/{bundleId}`` likewise declare none;
  the first reads ``CreateBundleRequest``, the second a whole
  ``CompositionRequest``, and the second also requires ``If-Match``.
* ``GET /price-overlays`` answers ``{overlays, page_info}`` — not the ``items``
  envelope every other list on this gear uses.

Pinning them here is what makes the document's gaps cost one failing test rather
than a client rewrite.

# The lifecycle verbs and their precondition

``POST /plans/{planId}/abandon`` **requires** ``If-Match``, and its URL ends in
the verb rather than in the plan id. A client that keys its validators by entity
id therefore attaches nothing and is refused — which is exactly what happened to
the pricing MFE, silently, until an end-to-end run put the gear's own sentence on
the screen. :func:`test_abandon_without_a_precondition_is_refused_by_its_code`
is that failure, pinned at the wire where the rule lives.
