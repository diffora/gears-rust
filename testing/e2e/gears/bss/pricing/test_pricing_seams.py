"""What the deployed bss-pricing gear can honestly be asked.

These run against a real binary, behind a real gateway, with a real authn
resolver and a real PDP. That is the half no in-process test can reach: the
routes are mounted, the header contracts hold on the wire, and the PEP is
genuinely in the request path.

# The publication path, and exactly how far it reaches here

Slice 5 mounted the entrance, so the two-person publish workflow is now
reachable end to end and :func:`test_a_material_change_blocks_until_a_second
_principal_has_seen_it` walks it: a material publish opens a pinned approval
unit and answers 202, the submitter's own approve is refused 403
``SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN`` **and lands a `deny` record on the plan's audit
segment**, an independent principal in the same tenant approves, and the second
publish takes the **commit** arm.

**The commit then stops, and it stops for a reason outside this gear.** There is
no `CatalogVersion` registry gear in this repository, so the module boots with
``UnconfiguredCatalogVersionRegistryV1`` — logged at start-up as *"no
CatalogVersionRegistryV1 registered; publish will fail closed until the registry
gear is wired"* — and ``request_version`` refuses. The commit's whole
transaction rolls back and the caller gets **503**. So the last inch of the walk
below asserts a 503 rather than a receipt, and it is written to prove the arm
was **reached**: a route that had not found the approval would have answered
another 202 and opened a second unit, and a route that had frozen the revision
would have left the plan out of ``draft``. Neither happened. When the registry
gear lands, that one assertion becomes a 200 and a receipt, and nothing else in
this module changes.

The other two blockers this module used to list are gone: the publish route
exists (Slice 5), and the joint conformance fixture registry in this repository
carries ``publish = true`` for every model kind, so the gate is **open** here —
which is why the pre-check below passes rather than refusing ``FIXTURE_MISSING``.

``tests/sqlite_read_model.rs`` still owns the publish → sweep → pin-eligible
projection in process, against a registry double. Asserting a weaker version of
it over HTTP would prove nothing new.

    """`GET .../sellability` on the wire: what it refuses, and what it publishes.

    Four properties in one case: two about what the surface **refuses**, and two
    about the **one document** an accepted request answers with — so the second pair
    costs one request between them rather than one each. The refusals come first
    because ``market_of`` runs before the authz gate, which is what makes them
    assertions about the parameter contract rather than about this caller's grants.

    1. **All three query parameters are required**, each refused by name. `at` is
       required rather than defaulted to this server's clock, deliberately: the
       contract of this surface is that the instant is the *caller's*, and a
       defaulted one would put the server's clock inside an answer the caller reads
       as being about their own moment (``market_of``). Asserted by equality on the
       problem document's ``detail``, which names the parameter.
    2. **A numeric offset is refused rather than repaired.** `+` is a *space* under
       form-urlencoding, so `…+00:00` written literally in a query string arrives as
       `…00:00` with a space where the sign was — not an instant in any format. Four
       in-crate cases answered 400 on exactly this before their helper switched to
       the `Z` form, and it is pinned in-crate by
       ``an_unencoded_offset_instant_is_refused_rather_than_guessed_at``. The two
       spellings here name the **same moment**, so the 400 can only be about the
       encoding: :data:`AT_UTC_DESIGNATOR` answers 200 in the same test.
    3. **There is no boolean anywhere in the document, at any depth.** What the
       surface publishes is intervals, states, a derived coverage end and
       per-predicate tokens; a boolean would freeze an answer to a question about
       the *reader's* clock into a store whose contract is that a completed version
       never changes (D-99). What this adds over the in-crate sweep is the
       **deployed** serializer through the real gateway; what it does **not** add is
       reach, and that limit is stated rather than left to be assumed: on this stand
       ``keys`` is empty, so the sweep here covers the plan-level half of the
       document only and a boolean introduced inside a per-key entry would pass it.
       ``rest_windows.rs``'s
       ``the_document_carries_intervals_and_a_coverage_end_and_no_boolean_anywhere``
       is the assertion that covers that half, because it stages a world with
       intervals in it — which is a thing no case on this deployment can do. When
       the registry lands and ``keys`` is populated here, this sweep becomes the
       stronger of the two and the sentence above should be deleted.
    4. **The surface is no existence oracle.** A plan id that names nothing at all
       is answered the same document, character for character, as a real plan of the
       caller's — which is the route's own decision (a 404 here would tell an
       unauthorized caller which plan ids exist). Whole-document equality modulo
       ``plan_id``, so a future arm that leaked existence through *any* field
       reddens.

    **This case pins a limitation as well as a capability, and the limitation is
    the answer's content.** No `CatalogVersionRegistryV1` exists on this stand, so
    no publish completes, so the tenant has no pin-eligible frontier and
    ``sellability_facts`` takes its ``NotAddressable`` arm for every plan. That is
    why the verdict is ``not_sellable`` with an empty key list and why predicate (2)
    is the one that ``failed``. **When the registry gear lands this changes, and the
    change is good news:** a published plan reads ``catalog_version`` non-null,
    predicate (2) ``satisfied``, one entry in ``keys`` for the row's market carrying
    predicate (1) and its intervals, and a verdict of ``not_evaluable`` — because
    predicates (5) and (6) owe a gear that is not in this repository and
    ``not_evaluable`` is **not** a yes. At that point the roster assertion below is
    what tells you which arm you are on, and it should be split in two.

    Nothing here reads the projected `state` token as the answer to "active at
    `t`": that token is the state at *projection* time and "active at `t`" is
    derived from ``interval ∧ now`` (D-99). On this arm there are no intervals to
    misread, which is precisely why the assertion that would misread them is absent
    rather than commented out.

    """The window plane's two-person path, driven to where **this stand** stops it.

    The sequence a plan's first window is authored by is forced and is not a
    deadlock: an **empty first publish**, then the billable row, then the window,
    then the publish that freezes them. ``coverage::check`` ranges over the
    *billable* set and an empty set yields no violations, so a rowless revision is a
    real publish candidate. This case drives that sequence in order through the
    mounted surfaces, and the step it cannot take is step one's **commit**: there is
    no ``CatalogVersionRegistryV1`` on this stand and ``config/e2e-local.yaml``
    exposes no key that would supply one, so ``request_version`` fails closed at
    **503** and the plan never holds a current revision.

    The `POST` that follows is therefore answered **404** by
    ``plan_repo::load_current``, and that 404 is the property this case is named
    for: it is raised while *assembling* the mutation, which is upstream of §3
    step 3a's materiality gate. So on this deployment **no window mutation is ever
    put in front of a reviewer** — not because nothing is material here (with no
    threshold policy configured every unit is material, which since G6's Task 2
    includes a schedule and a lengthening `PATCH`, and since the G4 fix wave always
    includes a `DELETE` and a shortening `PATCH` under D-62) but because the act is
    refused before that question is asked.

    **That absence is asserted rather than assumed, and it is not vacuous.** Step
    one's submit arm opens a real `plan_revision` unit on this very plan, so the
    unit-opening machinery is demonstrably live in this request path; what the
    approvals surface holds afterwards is that one unit and no `window` unit. A test
    that only asserted "no window unit" would pass on a deployment where no unit of
    any kind could be opened.

    **This case pins a limitation, and its reddening is good news.** When the
    registry gear lands, the 503 becomes a receipt, the plan holds a current
    revision, and the `POST` answers **202** with ``outcome =
    submitted_for_approval``, a pinned unit and no window — at which point this test
    should be rewritten to walk submit → independent approve → the act taking
    effect. Note before doing so that a materially-refused **`POST`** has no
    completion path today: the window id is minted per request, so the call made
    after the approve names a different subject and opens a *second* unit. The
    completable acts are `PATCH` and `DELETE`, whose window id is in the path; a
    schedule's remedy is a register entry nobody has minted, and the operator
    sequence the design set actually names is to configure a threshold policy first
    (which ``test_a_threshold_policy_takes_two_principals_before_it_is_in_force``
    walks) so that a schedule's zero delta reaches no bar and commits on one
    principal.

# A currency no other case uses — which is tidy and is **not** what protects the
# module. The argument that used to stand here was false and is worth stating so it
# is not reinvented: it claimed `inst-mat-percurrency`'s fail-safe half would answer
# `noConfiguredThreshold` for a `USD` row while a `CHF` policy was in force, leaving
# every other case untouched. `evaluate` never reaches that half here. Its order is
# registered trigger, then unset policy, then **`baseline is None` ->
# `firstPublish`**, and only then the per-currency walk — and on this stand no plan
# ever publishes, so `baseline` is `None` for every plan. With any policy approved,
# a `USD` publish therefore answers `firstPublish`, not `noConfiguredThreshold`, and
# the currency chosen is irrelevant. (The old counterfactual was wrong the same way:
# `rowWithoutBaseline` needs a baseline that exists.)
#
# **What actually protects the module is order plus the wipe**, neither of which is
# enforced: pytest collects in source order and this is the last case in the file,
# and the run protocol's `rm -rf ~/.cf-gears/bss-pricing` clears the store between
# runs. Both matter because the policy store is the one piece of tenant-singleton
# state this module writes, and the version this case approves is dated in the **past**,
# so it is in force the moment it is approved. (Until D-188 landed, a 2099 date was in
# force too — `effective_from` was compared against nothing — which is why an earlier
# revision of this comment said a future date was harmless. It is not harmless now for
# the opposite reason: a future-dated policy is never in force at all, and this case
# would assert against `null`.)
#
# So the cases that depend on an unset policy assert it as a **precondition** rather
# than trusting the ordering — see `_assert_no_effective_policy`. A run whose order
# changed then fails at the case that broke it, naming the policy, instead of three

    absent current revision. The policy store needs none: it is versioned and
    append-only, and "in force" is a fact read off the **approval** store rather
    than a column anything flips. So this is where an operator can be shown that
    the second signature is load-bearing rather than decorative.

    One case rather than four, because the value is the sequence: the unit id comes
    from the 202, the "still unset" read is only meaningful against a unit that is
    genuinely open, the self-approve refusal is only meaningful against one still
    pending, and the final read is only evidence if the approve before it landed.

    **The bootstrap is the point, and it is fail-safe.** A tenant with no policy has
    everything material (``inst-mat-failsafe``), so its *first* proposal is itself
    an always-material act — which is why no tenant can configure a threshold
    without completing an approved unit first, and why the verdict on the unit reads
    ``alwaysMaterialTrigger`` from ``materiality::evaluate`` over
    ``Trigger::ThresholdPolicyDiff`` rather than from a constant this surface wrote.

    This case pins a **capability**.

    **One thing about re-running it, established by watching it happen rather than
    reasoned about.** It asserts about *the version this `PUT` proposed* rather than
    about version 0, so a surviving SQLite file left by a **completed** run reads the
    same as a fresh one. A run this case *aborted part way* is different: the policy
    store is the one piece of tenant-singleton state this module writes, so a failure
    between the `PUT` and the approve leaves a **pending** unit, and the next run then
    fails at the first assertion below — ``pending_approval is None``, its own
    precondition — rather than at whatever was actually broken. If you meet that,
    the `pending_approval` in the failure message will name a version and the remedy
    is the ``rm -rf ~/.cf-gears/bss-pricing`` the run protocol already mandates; do
    not go looking for a defect in the policy store. Nothing else in this module has
    this property: every other case names a fresh plan and a fresh idempotency key.
