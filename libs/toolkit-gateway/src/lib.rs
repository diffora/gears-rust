//! `cf-gears-toolkit-gateway`: the gateway-provider abstraction for `OoP` edge
//! routing.
//!
//! This crate defines [`GatewayProvider`] — the trait the `OoP` bootstrap uses
//! to register a gear's public routes with an edge gateway — plus the typed
//! inputs it accepts ([`GearName`], [`OpenApiSpec`], [`Endpoint`]) and its error
//! type ([`GatewayError`]).
//!
//! It is a **leaf** crate: it does not depend on `cf-gears-toolkit`, so both
//! `cf-gears-toolkit` (the `OoP` bootstrap) and the `api-gateway` gear can depend
//! on it without introducing a dependency cycle.
//!
//! # Route visibility
//! Providers expose only the operations a gear marks **public** on the
//! visibility axis. `cf-gears-toolkit` emits this as the
//! [`API_VISIBILITY_EXTENSION`] `OpenAPI` vendor extension (value
//! [`API_VISIBILITY_PUBLIC`]) from `OperationSpec.is_exposed`; this crate mirrors
//! the well-known key as a constant so it needs no dependency on
//! `cf-gears-toolkit`.
