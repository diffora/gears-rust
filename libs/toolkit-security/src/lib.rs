//! Security primitives shared by every `ToolKit` gear: who a caller is, what
//! they are allowed to reach, and how a service proves its own identity to
//! another.
//!
//! A leaf crate by design — it depends on no other `ToolKit` library, so
//! anything from a bootstrap path to a gear's domain layer can use it without
//! pulling in the runtime.
//!
//! # The two planes
//!
//! `ToolKit` authenticates on two independent planes, and this crate carries
//! the types for both (`cpt-cf-adr-two-plane-auth`):
//!
//! - **Tenant plane** — a user's request. [`SecurityContext`] is the result:
//!   the subject, its tenant, and the token's capability scopes. Produced by a
//!   [`BearerAuthenticator`] from an `Authorization: Bearer` JWT.
//! - **Platform plane** — one service calling another. [`PlatformIdentity`] is
//!   the result, produced by an [`InternalAuthenticator`] from the
//!   [`constants::INTERNAL_TOKEN_HEADER`] credential. Never `Authorization`,
//!   so the two planes cannot be confused for one another.
//!
//! # Authorization
//!
//! [`AccessScope`] is what a policy decision compiles down to: a disjunction of
//! [`ScopeConstraint`]s, each a conjunction of [`ScopeFilter`]s over properties
//! like `owner_tenant_id`. `toolkit-db` turns it into a SQL `WHERE` clause so
//! row-level authorization is enforced by the query rather than by a check a
//! caller has to remember.
//!
//! Two shapes carry meaning and are easy to misread: an *unconstrained* scope
//! permits everything, and a *deny-all* scope permits nothing. The
//! `contains_*` accessors report on the constraint list alone, so both answer
//! "no" — see [`AccessScope::allows_uuid`] for the predicate that accounts for
//! the difference.
