//! GTS type definitions the broker owns.
//!
//! Two base types are declared here, and the broker declares nothing else. A
//! concrete topic is a well-known **instance** of [`TopicV1`]; a concrete event
//! type is a **derived type schema** under [`EventV1`], and a published event is
//! an instance of that derived type. Each is registered in `types-registry` by
//! whichever gear owns it, at that gear's init - never by the broker. An event's
//! `subject_type` is any GTS type id the producer chooses, typically its own
//! domain type (`gts.acme.crm.accounts.tenant.v1~`); the broker declares no
//! subject type.
//!
//! These declarations are the source of truth for the base schemas: the
//! process-wide `toolkit-gts` inventory seeds `types-registry` from what the
//! macro emits here, not from `docs/schemas/`. The base files under
//! `docs/schemas/` are generated from this module and held to it by
//! `gts_tests`, so per-field keywords live in the schemars attributes below.
//! Gears declare event types with `#[gts_type_schema(base = EventV1, ..)]`;
//! the derived struct's fields define the event's `data` contract.

/// A resolved event-type schema describes a whole event, and the base marks the

/// payload against it directly would fail on fields the producer is forbidden to
/// send. Producer-side validation therefore targets the payload contract alone,
/// which is what each type in the chain narrows.
///
/// Resolution inlines each ancestor into its descendant's `allOf`, so a chain
/// deeper than two nests `allOf` within `allOf`. The walk recurses for that
/// reason: a flat pass over the immediate branches would silently drop the
/// constraints of every type above the parent. Branches are visited before a
/// node's own `properties.data`, so ancestors compose ahead of descendants and
