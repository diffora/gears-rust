//! Zone-based throttling middleware.
//!
//! Two spec-driven maps are built from the registered operations:
//!
//! - [`ThrottlingMapNoAuth`] — operations whose `ThrottlingSpec` has
//!   `require_security_context = false`. Enforced *before* authentication and
//!   restricted to IP-keyed zones (identity keying is unavailable pre-auth).
//! - [`ThrottlingMap`] — operations with `require_security_context = true`.
//!   Enforced *after* authentication; identity-keyed zones use the subject id
//!   from the request's `SecurityContext`.
//!
//! Each `(method, path)` lands in exactly one map (decided by the per-operation
//! flag).
//!
//! On a served request, the rate-limit zone's `RateLimit-*` (and legacy
//! `X-RateLimit-*`) metadata headers are attached to the response.
//!
//! When an operation's `ThrottlingSpec` sets `dry_run = true`, limits are
//! observed but not enforced: a request that would have been rejected is served
//! instead, counted in the `throttling.dry_run_rejections` counter (attributes
//! `zone`/`kind`) and logged at `warn`.
