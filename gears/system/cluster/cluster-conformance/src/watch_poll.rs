// Created: 2026-08-03 by Constructor Tech
//! One bounded polling strategy, shared by every watch-driven scenario.
//!
//! Every suite in this crate faces the same problem: drive a watch until an
//! event satisfies a predicate, without letting a notification/polling
//! regression hang the whole suite (PGR-D4). [`poll_watch`] is that single
//! strategy — the cache, discovery and leader watches all reach it through
//! [`PollableWatch`], so a scenario never hand-rolls a `match watch.recv()`
//! loop with its own bounds.
//!
//! A poll is bounded two ways, both named and both overridable per call site:
//!
//! * [`DEFAULT_MAX_SKIPPED_EVENTS`] caps how many non-matching events it will
//!   skip before giving up — override with [`WatchPoll::max_skipped`].
//! * [`DEFAULT_WAIT_BUDGET`] wraps the whole poll in a timeout, so an event that
//!   never arrives (each individual `recv().await` is otherwise unbounded)
//!   resolves to a verdict rather than blocking forever — override with
//!   [`WatchPoll::upto`].
//!
//! Both bounds are backend-independent. Under
//! [`TimeControl::Virtual`](crate::time::TimeControl) a paused clock
//! auto-advances to the timeout while the runtime is idle, so an already-queued
//! event still returns immediately and an absent one still resolves at once — no
//! wall-clock cost, and the same code path as a real backend's NOTIFY / polling
//! round-trip. The defaults are generous enough for that round-trip; a scenario
//! that needs a tighter or looser bound says so at the call site:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Default bounds: 3s / 64 skipped events.
//! let seen = poll_watch(&mut watch).until(|e| matches!(e, CacheEvent::Changed { .. })).await;
//!
//! // Tighter budget: prove a *second* event does not arrive, without paying 3s for it.
//! let duplicate = poll_watch(&mut watch)
//!     .upto(Duration::from_millis(250))
//!     .until(|e| matches!(e, CacheEvent::Changed { .. }))
//!     .await;
//! ```
