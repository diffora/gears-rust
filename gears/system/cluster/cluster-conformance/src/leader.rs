// Created: 2026-06-24 by Constructor Tech
//! Leader-election conformance scenarios (`SC-LEAD-*`).
//!
//! See the [scenario catalog](../docs/scenarios/leader.md). Every plugin
//! feeds its `LeaderElectionBackend` — whether a native implementation or the
//! `cluster` gear's cache-derived default — into this suite:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::sync::Arc;
//! # use cluster_sdk::LeaderElectionBackend;
//! # use cluster_conformance::{run_leader_conformance, ScenarioBackend, TimeControl};
//! # async fn run<Fut>(make_backend: impl Fn() -> Fut)
//! # where Fut: std::future::Future<Output = ScenarioBackend<dyn LeaderElectionBackend>> {
//! // `TimeControl::Virtual` for in-memory fixtures; `TimeControl::Real` for a
//! // backend over a real connection pool (see `cluster_conformance::time`).
//! run_leader_conformance(make_backend, TimeControl::Virtual).await;
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! `SC-LEAD-008` (the ADR-009 weak-consistency constructor guard) is not a
//! scenario here — it exercises the concrete `CasBasedLeaderElectionBackend`
//! constructors directly, which this crate deliberately does not depend on
//! (every plugin depends on `cluster-conformance`, so this crate's real
//! dependencies stay limited to `cluster-sdk`). That guard is covered by the
//! `cluster` gear's own test suite
//! (`cluster/src/defaults/leader_tests.rs::new_rejects_eventually_consistent_cache`).
