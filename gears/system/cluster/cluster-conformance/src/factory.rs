//! [`ScenarioBackend`] — an async-built backend plus its teardown, the unit a
//! `run_*_conformance` runner drives one scenario against.
//!
//! The runners are generic over an **async** factory `Fn() -> Future<Output =
//! ScenarioBackend<_>>` so a backend whose construction is genuinely async
//! (opening a pool, running migrations, starting a container) can be built
//! fresh per scenario — an in-memory fixture just wraps a ready value. Each
//! backend is paired with a [`Teardown`] the runner awaits once the scenario
//! finishes, so a backend that needs an explicit async shutdown (e.g. a plugin
//! handle whose `Drop` guard panics if `stop()` was skipped) is released
//! deterministically between scenarios rather than leaked.

/// The scenario runs behind an async panic boundary so `teardown` is awaited
/// **even when a scenario assertion panics** (`AssertUnwindSafe` +
/// [`FutureExt::catch_unwind`](futures::FutureExt::catch_unwind)). Without it, a
/// panic would drop the `teardown` future un-awaited; a teardown owning a handle
/// with a panic-on-drop guard (e.g. `PostgresClusterHandle`) would then panic
/// during unwind and abort the whole test process, masking the original failure.
///
/// `teardown` is awaited behind its own panic boundary too: if it panics after
/// a scenario panic, resuming the scenario's panic (the actual assertion
/// failure) takes priority over the teardown's, so the original failure still
/// surfaces rather than being replaced by a cleanup-time panic. If the scenario
/// succeeded, a teardown panic is resumed instead.
