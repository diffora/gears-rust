//! [`TimeControl`] — how a time-sensitive conformance scenario makes time pass.
//!
//! Time-dependent scenarios (TTL expiry, lock timeout, leader renewal) need to
//! fast-forward past an interval without a test waiting real seconds. The
//! original suites did this with [`tokio::time::pause`] + [`tokio::time::advance`]
//! (virtual time), which is instant and deterministic — but only correct for
//! **in-memory** fixture backends. Against a backend over a real `sqlx` pool /
//! network, a paused virtual clock spuriously fires `sqlx`'s own internal
//! pool-acquire timeout: the paused runtime auto-advances the clock to the next
//! pending timer deadline while real network I/O is parked, so the acquire
//! `tokio::time::timeout` wins the race and every `pool.acquire()` returns a
//! bogus `PoolTimedOut` even on a completely free pool (see the postgres cluster
//! plugin's `docs/GAP-SOLUTIONS.md` §3 for the full trace).
//!
//! [`TimeControl`] lets one scenario body serve both worlds: fixture-backed
//! callers pass [`TimeControl::Virtual`] (unchanged fast/deterministic
//! behavior); real-backend callers pass [`TimeControl::Real`], which swaps the
//! virtual advance for a real (bounded) `tokio::time::sleep` and never pauses the
//! clock, so `sqlx`'s timers behave normally.
