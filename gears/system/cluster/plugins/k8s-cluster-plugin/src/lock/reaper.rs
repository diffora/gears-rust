//! The stale lock-object reaper (DESIGN.md §5.5).
//!
//! Release *clears* a lock's `holderIdentity`; it does not delete the object (§5.5),
//! so one empty Lease accumulates per lock name ever used. For a bounded name space
//! that is a handful of objects; for an unbounded one it is an etcd leak. The reaper
//! bounds it: every `reaper_interval` it lists this plugin's Leases in the namespace
//! and issues a **guarded delete** (on `resourceVersion` *and* `uid`) of each
//! `primitive=lock` Lease whose holder is empty and whose `renewTime` is older than
//! `lock_object_retention`.
//!
//! Two properties keep it from becoming its own problem, both tested here at the
//! decision level: it is **safe to run from every replica** — two reapers racing
//! means one gets a `409` and moves on, which the guarded delete already yields as
//! `Ok(false)` — and the `uid` precondition means a reap can never land on a
//! *different* lock object that reused the name after a delete-and-recreate.
