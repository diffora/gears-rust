//! The leader-election watch: mapping a `kube::runtime::watcher` stream to
//! leadership transitions (DESIGN.md §4.3).
//!
//! Status is watch-driven, not poll-driven: each active election runs a watcher
//! field-selected on `metadata.name`, so the stream carries only this one Lease and
//! delivers a holder change in milliseconds rather than up to a renewal interval
//! late. The stream is mapped in two pure stages, both unit-tested here:
//!
//! 1. [`classify_event`] reduces a `watcher::Event<Lease>` to a coarse
//!    [`WatchSignal`] — the object's holder, a vacancy, a re-list, or a boundary
//!    marker — collapsing the five event kinds to the four the state machine cares
//!    about.
//! 2. [`holder_transitions`] maps `(previous status, observed holder, our identity)`
//!    to the ordered [`LeaderStatus`] transitions to emit, deduplicated against the
//!    previous status so a healthy holder's repeated `renewTime` advance is not a
//!    transition.
//!
//! `Lagged` is never synthesised here: the K8s watch protocol has no "fell behind
//! by N" signal — a watcher that cannot keep up gets a `410 Gone` and re-lists,
//! which is [`WatchSignal::Relisted`] (→ `Reset`), not a fabricated count (§4.3).
