//! Native leader election over one `Lease` per election (DESIGN.md §4).
//!
//! [`K8sLeaderElection`] implements [`LeaderElectionBackend`] over
//! `coordination.k8s.io/v1.Lease`. Each active election runs one background task
//! that owns the whole lifecycle: it establishes a `metadata.name`-scoped watch
//! *before* its first acquire (so a transition between the two cannot be missed,
//! §4.3), claims or follows, renews on the derived interval (§4.2), reconciles
//! status from the watch (§4.3), services an explicit [`resign`](LeaderWatch::resign)
//! (§4.4), and revokes cleanly on shutdown (§11).
//!
//! Two pure state machines the task drives live in the submodules and carry the L1
//! coverage: [`renew`] (the renewal-outcome decision) and [`watch`] (the
//! watcher-event → leadership-transition mapping). Real-server behaviour is
//! exercised in Phase 6.
