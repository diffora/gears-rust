//! Startup preflight (DESIGN.md §3.4, §6.7).
//!
//! `build_and_start` issues a bounded, read-only set of requests before returning,
//! turning every predictable runtime failure into a *startup* failure an operator
//! can act on, rather than a `403` on the first background renewal minutes later:
//!
//! 1. **Server version** (`GET /version`) — recorded on the startup log line;
//!    unreadable is a WARN, never fatal (nothing in v1 is version-gated).
//! 2. **RBAC probe** — one `SelfSubjectAccessReview` per `(verb, resource)` the
//!    *enabled* primitives need (§7). A denial fails startup naming the exact verb;
//!    the SSAR itself being denied is a degrade-with-WARN, and `skip_rbac_preflight`
//!    is the explicit escape hatch.
//! 3. **CRD canary** (cache only) — a create-then-delete of a **per-instance**
//!    `ClusterCacheEntry` that proves in one shot the CRD is installed *and* its
//!    served schema accepts what this plugin version writes (§6.7).
//!
//! The decision logic — which `(verb, resource)` each primitive needs, the
//! per-instance canary key, and how a denial reads back to an operator — is factored
//! into pure functions ([`probe_set`], [`canary_key`], [`rbac_failure_message`],
//! [`probe_denied`]) that the L1 suite covers exhaustively; the async wrappers do
//! only the I/O.
