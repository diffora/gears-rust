//! The `cluster_cache` TTL sweeper background task (DESIGN.md §4.2).
//!
//! Wakes on a configurable interval and deletes every expired entry,
//! `NOTIFY`-ing `E:<key>` for each so watchers receive
//! `CacheWatchEvent::Event(CacheEvent::Expired { key })`. Driven by a
//! [`CancellationToken`]; self-terminates when cancelled.
//!
//! Takes no [`WatchRegistry`](crate::cache::watch::WatchRegistry) reference:
//! the `NOTIFY` this sweep issues reaches this same instance's local watchers
//! (and every other instance's) via the dedicated LISTEN connection's normal
//! round-trip, exactly like a `put`/`delete` call — see `cache/watch.rs`'s
//! module doc for why that round-trip is the correct fan-out path, not a
//! shortcut worth bypassing here.
//!
//! ## Chunking
//!
//! A sweep is a *loop* of bounded transactions ([`SWEEP_BATCH`] rows each), not
//! one unbounded `DELETE` — the same shape `lock::reaper` uses, and for two
//! reasons that both scale with backlog size rather than with the configured
//! interval:
//!
//! * **Lock-hold time.** `DELETE ... RETURNING` holds a row lock on every
//!   matching row until commit, and each deleted key costs a sequential
//!   `pg_notify` round-trip before that commit. Unbounded, a concurrent
//!   `put`/`put_if_absent` on a key caught mid-batch does not wait for a quick
//!   row lock — it waits out the *rest of the whole backlog's* `NOTIFY` loop,
//!   on a write-pool connection pinned for that entire span. Chunking caps both
//!   the pinned-connection span and the `NOTIFY` burst at one batch's worth.
//! * **Partial progress.** All-or-nothing means one transient failure anywhere
//!   in the loop rolls back the entire batch, so the tick reclaims *nothing*.
//!   Should the expiry rate ever outpace one sweep, every later tick would
//!   re-attempt the same, larger, still-all-or-nothing batch and never eat into
//!   the backlog. Per-chunk transactions commit as they go, so a failing chunk
//!   costs only its own rows and the ones already committed stay reclaimed.
//!
//! Each chunk keeps its delete and that chunk's `NOTIFY`s in **one**
//! transaction: the atomicity that matters is per-event (never a row deleted
//! with its `Expired` event lost, nor the reverse — DESIGN.md §4.1), and that
//! is preserved by a bounded transaction just as well as by an unbounded one.
