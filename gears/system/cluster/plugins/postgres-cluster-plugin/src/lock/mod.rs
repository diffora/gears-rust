//! `PostgresLock` — the native `DistributedLockBackend` implementation over the
//! `cluster_lock` lease row (DESIGN.md §5), plus the standalone
//! `PostgresLockPlugin` builder/handle (DESIGN.md §3.5) that lets an operator
//! route `lock` to Postgres independently of `cache`.
//!
//! ## The row is the arbiter
//!
//! A lock is held **iff** a `cluster_lock` row exists whose `expires_at` is in
//! the future *and* whose recorded beacon is still granted in `pg_locks`. Every
//! acquire, renew, and release is a single statement against the write pool,
//! with no session affinity and **no in-process state that is load-bearing for
//! exclusion**.
//!
//! Three mechanisms cooperate inside the acquire statement, and the primary key
//! does the least work of the three:
//!
//! 1. **`PRIMARY KEY (name)` detects the conflict**, giving `ON CONFLICT`
//!    something to fire on. It decides nothing.
//! 2. **The row lock serializes.** On conflict Postgres takes an exclusive lock
//!    on the conflicting tuple, so a competing transaction holding it makes us
//!    *block* until it commits or aborts.
//! 3. **The `WHERE` decides**, evaluated against the **latest committed**
//!    version of the row — not the snapshot the statement started with.
//!
//! Step 3 is what makes it correct, and it is `READ COMMITTED` behaviour
//! (asserted at startup by `pg_setup::assert_read_committed`): two acquirers
//! cannot both observe the lock as free, because the loser re-evaluates against
//! the winner's already-committed state. `RETURNING` is the answer — a row means
//! acquired, whether by insert or by steal; zero rows means contended. There is
//! no third case, and two tasks in *this* process race exactly as two instances
//! do, which is why no in-process claim registry is needed to arbitrate them.
//!
//! ## `pg_advisory_unlock` is never called — but rows are deleted constantly
//!
//! Two different things are called "lock" around here, so this is worth being
//! exact about. Releasing a lock still means **deleting its row**, and five
//! paths do exactly that: `release`, the TTL sweep, the orphan sweep, the
//! shutdown drain, and the beacon's post-reconnect hand-over.
//!
//! What no longer happens is the *advisory-lock* release: nothing per-lock is
//! ever `pg_advisory_lock`ed, so there is no session-scoped `pg_advisory_unlock`
//! to pair with it. (The one advisory lock this plugin takes is the per-instance
//! beacon, and that one is released only by its connection closing —
//! `lock::beacon`.)
//!
//! The consequence is what matters: deleting a row is something **any** instance
//! can do, whereas an advisory unlock could only ever be issued by the session
//! that took it. An expired or unvouched row is therefore stealable by the
//! acquire predicate itself, evaluated by whoever asks — no reclaim step, and no
//! reason reclamation has to route back to the instance that held the lock. That
//! is what lets a crashed *or merely wedged* holder's lock be taken by anyone,
//! rather than only by a healthy reaper on the owning instance.
//!
//! The one surviving in-process registry, [`PostgresLock::local_holders`], is an
//! input to garbage collection and **not** a participant in mutual exclusion —
//! see its doc.
