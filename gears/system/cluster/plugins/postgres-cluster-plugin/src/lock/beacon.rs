//! The **liveness beacon** (DESIGN.md §5.1): one advisory lock per *instance*,
//! held on a dedicated connection outside the pool, used for nothing except
//! proving this process is alive.
//!
//! ## What it is, and what it is not
//!
//! The beacon is not a lock. It is a **crash-triggered tombstone**, and an
//! advisory lock is the only Postgres primitive that is all four of:
//!
//! 1. **Established by one statement** — no schema, no row, no WAL, and no
//!    write ever again.
//! 2. **Readable from any other session in SQL** (`pg_locks`), and therefore
//!    joinable inside the acquire statement's own predicate. The liveness test
//!    is atomic with the acquire decision rather than a second round-trip to
//!    race against.
//! 3. **Deleted by the server** the instant the session ends. Nothing has to
//!    maintain it — no heartbeat keeping it alive, no TTL, no reaper. (The ping
//!    below is not maintenance; see "Why the ping".)
//! 4. **Unfiltered by privilege** — `pg_locks` shows every lock in the cluster
//!    to every role, unlike `pg_stat_activity`, which nulls most columns for
//!    other roles' sessions.
//!
//! Property 3 is the whole point: it is what gives a crashed holder's locks back
//! to the fleet without waiting out their TTL, and it is the one property that
//! cannot be rebuilt in application code without reintroducing an interval loop,
//! a heartbeat TTL, and a reaper for it.
//!
//! The key is ours to choose, so it is drawn fresh per **incarnation**. That is
//! what makes every row bearing it provably one this process wrote, on this
//! connection — the basis for the orphan sweep, the shutdown drain, and the
//! post-reconnect cleanup, none of which need any other fence.
//!
//! ## Hard invariants
//!
//! * **The beacon is never released explicitly.** Not when a lock is released,
//!   not when one expires, not at shutdown. Releasing it while this process is
//!   still running asserts that the instance is *dead*, and every lock it holds
//!   becomes stealable on sight. Closing the connection is the only correct way
//!   for it to end, and at shutdown that happens anyway.
//! * **Never the blocking `pg_advisory_lock`.** A blocking form would park this
//!   task inside Postgres waiting for a key nobody can hand over. Only
//!   `pg_try_advisory_lock`, whose `false` here means a key collision — draw
//!   another and retry.
//! * **The connection carries no lock traffic at all.** No lock name, no
//!   `holder_id`, no row, ever. It needs no request queue, no actor mailbox, no
//!   `search_path`, and — because it writes nothing — no `synchronous_commit`
//!   assertion or re-assertion either.
//!
//! ## Why the ping
//!
//! An idle `PgConnection` is never polled, so a beacon whose backend died is not
//! noticed by *this* process until something tries to use it — and nothing ever
//! does. Without local detection the semantics would quietly weaken to "you
//! remain the holder until someone with a live beacon takes it from you": our
//! own `renew` would keep matching its row and reporting success, because the
//! row still carries our `holder_id` and our now-dead key. No mutual exclusion
//! is violated — the moment another instance steals, the `holder_id` fence makes
//! the next `renew` fail — but the instance would go on believing it holds a
//! lock it can no longer defend, for as long as nobody else wants it.
//!
//! So this task pings its own connection once a second and treats a failed ping
//! as loss. The server needs no such prompting: it releases the beacon at
//! disconnect regardless. The ping is how *we* find out.
//!
//! ## The real bound on "immediate"
//!
//! A clean exit or socket close releases the beacon at once. A hard kill or a
//! partition that leaves the TCP connection half-open leaves the backend blocked
//! in `recv`, still holding the beacon, until keepalives fire — so the honest
//! statement of the guarantee is "immediate on clean disconnect,
//! keepalive-bounded otherwise, TTL-bounded in the worst case".
//!
//! Tightening that bound is a **server-side** lever, which is why
//! [`TCP_KEEPALIVE_SETTINGS`] are `SET` on this session rather than configured
//! on the client socket. Client-side `keepalives_*` would help us detect a dead
//! *server*, which the ping above already does faster; what matters here is
//! Postgres noticing that **we** are gone.
