## 1. Feature Context

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-usage-collector-feature-foundation`

### 1.1 Overview

Establishes the Usage Collector's stateless gear runtime substrate and its three public contract surfaces — the in-process SDK trait, the REST API, and the storage Plugin SPI — so that every later capability (UsageType Catalog, Usage Emission, Usage Query, Event Deactivation, Compensation) plugs into a single, identical execution shape. The foundation owns plugin host binding, `SecurityContext` acceptance plus PDP dispatch through the shared `domain/authz.rs` helpers, audit-correlation propagation, and deployment topology.

Operational metrics reach the platform exclusively through OTLP push via ToolKit's `SdkMeterProvider`. Platform liveness/readiness probes are handled by the ToolKit host above the gear boundary; no gear-local health endpoints are exposed. The foundation also owns the gear's observability substrate: the scoped `Meter` bootstrap and instrument naming convention, the label-cardinality policy, and the plugin-host and PDP-helper instruments inventoried in [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) — sibling features own the emit points and DoDs for the ingestion, query, deactivation, and usage-type-lifecycle instruments.

Authentication is owned by the ToolKit gateway upstream of the collector. Every request arrives carrying a resolved `SecurityContext`, and PDP enforcement is dispatched by each domain method through the per-operation helpers in `domain/authz.rs` — among them `authorize` for catalog ops and `authorize_usage_record` for the ingestion surface, each routing through the shared `PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(...)` enforcement call (the full per-operation helper set is enumerated in the PDP-Helper Instruments DoD). These helpers split by resource type per ADR-0012 / PRD §5.8: the catalog helper (`authorize`) calls `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` with `require_constraints(false)` (the catalog is platform-global), so an unconstrained permit (`allow_all`) is a legitimate happy-path outcome. The ingestion helper (`authorize_usage_record`, delegating to `authorize_attribution_tuple`) calls with `require_constraints(true)` and gates the returned scope against the record's attribution tuple (`scope_admits_attribution_tuple`): a returned constraint must pin the record's owning tenant, and an unconstrained (`allow_all`) permit is denied fail-closed.

### 1.2 Purpose

This feature exists so safety-critical behavior — fail-closed authentication, PDP-mediated authorization, and audit-correlation propagation — is realized once at the substrate layer rather than re-implemented per feature, and so storage vendors can ship and migrate backends independently of the core release train through a contract-stable Plugin SPI bound through the GTS Registry and ClientHub, which is the single seam through which both `usage_records` and the plugin-owned `usage_type_catalog` table are persisted.

**Requirements**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-pluggable-storage`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-data-classification`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-availability`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-plugin-contract-stability`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-operational-visibility`

**Principles**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-pluggable-storage`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-plugin-resolution-via-client-hub`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-contract-stability`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-pdp-centric-authorization`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-otlp-push-emission`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-gateway-http-server-instrument-reuse`

**Platform dependencies (foundation-level)**: `toolkit` (gear wiring, `#[toolkit::gear]`, `ClientHub`, and the global `SdkMeterProvider` constructed via `opentelemetry::global::meter_with_scope("usage_collector", …)` at gear bootstrap), `toolkit-gts` (`PluginV1<P>` GTS base type and the `gts_type_schema` derive consumed by `usage-collector-sdk/src/gts.rs` to declare `UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1`), `types-registry-sdk` (`TypesRegistryClient::list_instances` consumed by `GtsPluginSelector` lazily on the first dispatch call after the `types-registry` is consistent — there is no runtime config-change channel that would re-trigger this query), `toolkit-security` (`SecurityContext` propagation), and `toolkit-canonical-errors` (canonical `Problem` envelope on the REST surface; taken by the host crate `usage-collector` only — the SDK crate `usage-collector-sdk` does NOT depend on it, and the host's `From<UsageCollectorError> for CanonicalError` lift in `usage-collector/src/infra/sdk_error_mapping.rs` produces the canonical Problem envelope from the flat SDK error per DESIGN §3.3 Error Envelopes).

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor                                             | Role in Feature                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`       | Arrives at the foundation carrying a gateway-resolved `SecurityContext`; the shared `domain/authz.rs` helper authorizes emission (substrate-only role here; emission semantics owned by §2.3)                             |

| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-tenant-admin`       | Arrives at the foundation carrying a gateway-resolved `SecurityContext` scoped to their own tenant; PDP authorization is dispatched uniformly by every domain method through the shared `domain/authz.rs` helpers |

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

### Plugin Host Binding (Lazy Resolve)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-plugin-host-binding`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source` | `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-consumer` | `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-tenant-admin` | `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator` (the first downstream caller whose dispatch causes the lazy resolve; the operator only contributes by selecting `[usage_collector].vendor` at gear bootstrap, not by triggering this flow directly)

**Success Scenarios**:

- **Cold path (first dispatch)**: at gear bootstrap the host `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host` reads the vendor selection from `[usage_collector].vendor` once, constructs the gateway-side service with an embedded GTS plugin selector (no instance resolution happens yet), and registers the consumer-facing `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-sdk-client` in ClientHub. Independently, each `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-storage-backend` plugin gear publishes a `PluginV1<UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1>` instance through the types-registry client and registers its scoped `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` trait object in ClientHub under the corresponding GTS instance scope. On the first dispatch after the types-registry is consistent, the selector queries the registry by `UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1::gts_schema_id()`, applies the configured vendor + priority selection (lowest priority wins), and caches the resolved `PluginBinding` for the service's lifetime.
- **Warm path (cached selector hit)**: subsequent dispatches reuse the cached `GtsInstanceId` and obtain the scoped `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` handle via `ClientHub::try_get_scoped` with no further types-registry round-trip.

**Error Scenarios**:

- The types-registry is unreachable on the first dispatch — the per-call selector initialization surfaces a `PluginUnavailable` outcome (per the published Plugin SPI error taxonomy) to that caller; the selector remains uncached and the next dispatch retries the lazy resolve. The host's `uc_plugin_ready` gauge reports `0` until the structural readiness fact holds.
- No plugin instance is registered under the resolved GTS instance scope (for example a plugin gear's bootstrap failed before its scoped registration step, or the dispatch arrived before that step ran) — `ClientHub::try_get_scoped` returns `None`, which the host lifts to a per-call `PluginUnavailable` outcome on the published Plugin SPI error taxonomy. The `uc_plugin_ready` gauge reflects the same structural fact.
- Binding selection is monotonic for the service's lifetime: once the selector has cached an instance id, that selection is reused until the gear restarts. There is no runtime configuration-change channel that would re-trigger resolution (re-binding requires a gear restart).

**Steps**:

1. [x] - `p1` - At gear bootstrap, read the vendor selection from `[usage_collector].vendor` once and construct the gateway-side service with an embedded GTS plugin selector; no types-registry query is performed here - `inst-binding-config-read-once`
2. [x] - `p1` - At the same gear bootstrap, construct the full foundation-owned instrument set from [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) (`uc_plugin_ready`, `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total`, `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds`, `uc_pdp_failures_total`, `uc_pdp_duration_seconds`, `uc_authz_decisions_total`, `uc_pdp_ready`) on `opentelemetry::global::meter_with_scope("usage_collector", …)` from ToolKit's global `SdkMeterProvider` — full literal Prometheus names under the substitutable `uc_` prefix, no `.with_unit(...)` hint on any instrument, OTLP push only (no `/metrics` scrape endpoint) per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-otlp-push-emission` - `inst-binding-meter-bootstrap`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Each storage-backend plugin gear publishes its `PluginV1<UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1>` instance through the types-registry client, then registers its scoped `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` trait object in ClientHub under the corresponding GTS instance scope - `inst-binding-clienthub-register`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the selector cache is empty (cold path) - `inst-binding-cold-path`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Query the types-registry by `UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1::gts_schema_id()` and apply the configured vendor + priority selection (lowest priority wins) - `inst-binding-lazy-resolve`
   2. [x] - `p1` - Cache the resolved `PluginBinding` exactly once for the service's lifetime - `inst-binding-cache-instance-id`
5. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** (warm path) reuse the cached `GtsInstanceId` without a types-registry round-trip - `inst-binding-warm-path`
6. [x] - `p1` - Resolve the scoped `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` handle via `ClientHub::try_get_scoped` on the GTS instance scope; **IF** the lookup returns no handle **RETURN** a `PluginUnavailable` outcome on the per-call path per the published Plugin SPI error taxonomy - `inst-binding-try-get-scoped`
7. [x] - `p1` - Compute the structural readiness fact for the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` and reflect it on the `uc_plugin_ready` gauge (`1` when both facts hold — selector has cached an instance id AND `ClientHub::try_get_scoped` returns a handle — `0` otherwise) - `inst-binding-readiness-fact`
8. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the resolved scoped `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` handle to the calling pipeline so the dispatch can complete; warm-path calls reuse the cached id and the cached scoped handle with no further types-registry round-trip - `inst-binding-return-handle`
9. [x] - `p1` - On the gear serve lifecycle, refresh the `uc_usage_types` catalog gauge on a fixed interval by paginating the plugin-owned usage_type_catalog through the resolved binding; an unbound plugin (lazy binding not yet resolved) or a failed read leaves the gauge at its prior value and retries on the next tick - `inst-serve-usage-types-gauge-refresh`

### PDP Authorize and Constraint Return

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source` | `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-consumer` | `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-tenant-admin` | `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator` (any caller whose domain-component invocation triggers the shared PDP dispatch helpers in `domain/authz.rs`; PDP authorize is a reusable algorithmic seam invoked inside every domain-component method, not an actor-initiated flow on its own)

**Success Scenarios**:

- With the inbound `SecurityContext` (resolved upstream by the ToolKit gateway on REST or supplied by the caller on the in-process SDK) and the operation's attribution, the domain component handling the call invokes the applicable per-operation PDP authorization helper in `domain/authz.rs` (for example `authorize` for catalog ops or `authorize_usage_record` for the ingestion surface), which calls `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` with the attributes that apply to the operation's resource type (per ADR-0012 / PRD §5.8: the catalog helper uses `require_constraints(false)`, so an unconstrained permit, `allow_all`, is a legitimate happy-path outcome; the ingestion helper uses `require_constraints(true)` and gates the returned scope against the record's attribution tuple — the owning tenant must be pinned by a returned constraint, so an unconstrained `allow_all` permit is denied fail-closed). The helper returns `Ok(())` to the caller on permit and never caches the decision; downstream constraint-intersection lands in Usage Query when its first caller arrives.

**Error Scenarios**:

- The `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` is unreachable or times out — fail closed with a deterministic platform-authorization error (`AuthorizationUnavailable`), never serve a cached or permissive decision.
- The resolver returns deny — the operation is rejected immediately with an actionable error envelope (`AuthorizationDenied`) and no plugin dispatch is performed.
- The resolver returns `CompileFailed` for the (resource, action) tuple — the helper collapses this to the same `AuthorizationDenied` envelope (fail closed; a non-deny compile-failure must never derive a permissive fallback, on either the `require_constraints(false)` catalog path or the `require_constraints(true)` ingestion / list paths).

**Steps**:

1. [x] - `p1` - Receive (`SecurityContext`, operation descriptor, attribution) from the surface boundary; the `SecurityContext` is already resolved upstream of the collector by the ToolKit gateway (REST) or supplied by the in-process SDK caller - `inst-pdp-input`
2. [x] - `p1` - Compose the attribution required by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` for the operation's resource type (catalog ops carry no resource attributes; usage-record submission adds `OWNER_TENANT_ID`, `OWNER_ID`, `resource_type`, `resource_id`) and call the applicable `domain/authz.rs` helper (catalog `authorize` with `require_constraints(false)`; usage-record `authorize_usage_record` with `require_constraints(true)` plus the `scope_admits_attribution_tuple` gate) - `inst-pdp-compose-tuple`
3. [x] - `p1` - **TRY** invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` via the shared PDP helper (`enforcer.access_scope_with(...)`) - `inst-pdp-resolver-call`
4. [x] - `p1` - **CATCH** transport-or-evaluation failure (`EnforcerError::EvaluationFailed`) - `inst-pdp-resolver-catch`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `AuthorizationUnavailable` (no cached decision, no permissive fallback) - `inst-pdp-fail-closed`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the returned `PdpDecision` is deny **RETURN** `AuthorizationDenied` so the operation is rejected at the boundary - `inst-pdp-deny`
6. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `Ok(())` to the bound domain component without caching the result; the helper does not propagate constraint sets (intersection with user-supplied read filters lands in the read-path features when their first caller arrives) - `inst-pdp-return`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### Plugin Host Binding (Lazy Resolution)

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-host-binding`

**Input**: the vendor selection (already cached on the gateway-side service from `[usage_collector].vendor` at gear bootstrap), the embedded GTS plugin selector's current cache state (cached instance id after the first successful resolve, or empty before it), and the types-registry client + ClientHub handles obtained from the gear context.

**Output**: a scoped `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` handle for the lazily resolved `PluginBinding` (cached `GtsInstanceId` + scoped trait object reachable via `ClientHub::try_get_scoped` on the GTS instance scope), or a per-call deterministic `PluginUnavailable` outcome on the published Plugin SPI error taxonomy when either the registry call fails, no instance matches the vendor + priority selection, or the scoped client slot is empty. The `uc_plugin_ready` gauge reflects the resulting structural readiness fact; the SPI exposes no plugin-side `ready()` probe (the structural readiness fact is the sole readiness signal — see `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` DoD).

**Steps**:

1. [x] - `p1` - On every dispatch, enter the gateway-side `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host` resolution seam and invoke its embedded GTS plugin selector cache lookup - `inst-algo-binding-enter-selector`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the selector cache is empty (cold path) - `inst-algo-binding-cold-path`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **TRY** query the types-registry for instances of `UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1` by its GTS schema id and apply the configured vendor + priority selection (lowest priority wins) - `inst-algo-binding-resolve-plugin`
   2. [x] - `p1` - **CATCH** registry-or-selector failure - `inst-algo-binding-catch`
      1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** a `PluginUnavailable` outcome per the published Plugin SPI error taxonomy (covering both registry unavailability and no-match outcomes) on the per-call path; the selector cache remains empty so the next dispatch retries the lazy resolve - `inst-algo-binding-plugin-unavailable-cold`
   3. [x] - `p1` - Cache the resolved `PluginBinding` exactly once for the service's lifetime - `inst-algo-binding-cache-instance-id`
3. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** (warm path) reuse the cached `GtsInstanceId` without a types-registry round-trip - `inst-algo-binding-warm-path`
4. [x] - `p1` - Resolve the scoped `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` handle via `ClientHub::try_get_scoped` on the GTS instance scope; **IF** the lookup returns no handle **RETURN** a `PluginUnavailable` outcome per the published Plugin SPI error taxonomy on the per-call path - `inst-algo-binding-try-get-scoped`
5. [x] - `p1` - Compute the structural readiness fact (selector has cached an instance id AND `ClientHub::try_get_scoped` returns a handle under the GTS instance scope) and set `uc_plugin_ready` to `1` when both facts hold or `0` otherwise - `inst-algo-binding-readiness-fact`
6. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the resolved scoped `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` handle to the calling pipeline so the dispatch completes; warm-path subsequent calls hit the selector fast path and the ClientHub read seam and reuse both caches with no further types-registry round-trip - `inst-algo-binding-return`

### PDP Authorize

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-pdp-authorize`

**Input**: a reference to the `SecurityContext` (resolved upstream by the ToolKit gateway on REST or supplied by the in-process SDK caller), the operation descriptor, and the operation's attribution (catalog ops carry no resource attributes; usage-record submission adds `OWNER_TENANT_ID`, optional `OWNER_ID`, `resource_type`, `resource_id`).

**Output**: `Ok(())` surfaced to the bound domain component on permit, or `AuthorizationDenied` / `AuthorizationUnavailable` on deny / transport failure. The helper does not propagate a constraint set — constraint intersection with user-supplied read filters lands in Usage Query when its first caller arrives. As a side effect, the helper is the single realization point for the four PDP-helper instruments inventoried in [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) (`uc_pdp_duration_seconds`, `uc_authz_decisions_total`, `uc_pdp_failures_total`, `uc_pdp_ready`) so every capability feature inherits them without respecifying; the `operation` label derives from the caller-supplied operation descriptor (nine-value gateway set: `ingest`, `query_raw`, `query_aggregated`, `get_record`, `deactivate`, `usage_type_create`, `usage_type_get`, `usage_type_list`, `usage_type_delete`).

**Steps**:

1. [x] - `p1` - Compose the attribution from the caller-supplied operation descriptor and the resolved `SecurityContext`, applying the attributes that match the operation's resource type — with `require_constraints(false)` on the catalog `authorize` path (an `allow_all` permit is a legitimate happy path) or `require_constraints(true)` on the usage-record / list paths (the returned scope is gated against the operation's attribution, so an `allow_all` permit is denied fail-closed) - `inst-algo-pdp-compose`
2. [x] - `p1` - Reflect the PDP readiness fact on the `uc_pdp_ready` gauge — set to `1` while the `authz-resolver` client is bound in the bootstrap-constructed `PolicyEnforcer`, `0` otherwise (a structural bootstrap-binding fact per [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002); unlike `uc_plugin_ready`, the AuthZ client is resolved once at gear bootstrap — held inside `PolicyEnforcer` — not lazily per call, so there is **no** per-call structural readiness short-circuit on this path) — and capture the monotonic start instant of the PDP round-trip for `uc_pdp_duration_seconds` - `inst-algo-pdp-ready-gauge`
3. [x] - `p1` - **TRY** invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` via the shared PDP helper (`enforcer.access_scope_with(...)`) with the composed attribution - `inst-algo-pdp-call`
4. [x] - `p1` - **CATCH** transport-or-evaluation failure (`EnforcerError::EvaluationFailed`) - `inst-algo-pdp-catch`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Observe the elapsed round-trip on `uc_pdp_duration_seconds` (label: `operation`) — failure completions are still completions — and increment `uc_pdp_failures_total` (labels: `operation`, `cause`). **v1 `cause` projection:** the caught `EnforcerError::EvaluationFailed` wraps `AuthZResolverError` (`NoPluginAvailable` / `ServiceUnavailable` / `Internal`), which carries no timeout discriminator, and no host-side PDP-dispatch deadline exists, so every such failure maps to `cause="unreachable"`; `cause="timeout"` is reserved per [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) and is not emitted until a host-side deadline is introduced (see the limitations note on the PDP-helper DoD). PDP denials are decisions, not failures, and never land on this counter - `inst-algo-pdp-failure-metrics`
   2. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `AuthorizationUnavailable`; never serve a cached or permissive decision - `inst-algo-pdp-fail-closed`
5. [x] - `p1` - Observe the elapsed round-trip on `uc_pdp_duration_seconds` (label: `operation`) and increment `uc_authz_decisions_total` (labels: `operation`, `decision` ∈ `permit` | `deny`) for the **effective** decision: `permit` only once the caller-supplied post-permit gate admits the returned scope (an always-admitting gate on the catalog path; the per-record attribution gate / the LIST scope→OData projection on the `require_constraints(true)` paths), and `deny` when a hard PDP deny OR a gate rejection of a permit-with-constraints (e.g. cross-tenant attribution outside the granted scope) fails the request closed — so the reconnaissance signal is not mislabeled `permit`. Exactly one of this counter or `uc_pdp_failures_total` fires per authorization; failures and timeouts are not decisions and land on `uc_pdp_failures_total` via `inst-algo-pdp-failure-metrics` instead - `inst-algo-pdp-decision-metrics`
6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the returned `PdpDecision` is deny (`EnforcerError::Denied` or fail-closed `EnforcerError::CompileFailed`) **RETURN** `AuthorizationDenied` - `inst-algo-pdp-deny`
7. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `Ok(())` to the bound domain component without caching the result - `inst-algo-pdp-return`

### Plugin SPI Dispatch Instrumentation

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-spi-dispatch-instrumentation`

**Input**: the dispatched Plugin SPI method name (the `operation` label — one of the ten SPI method names enumerated for `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total` / `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds` in [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002): `create_usage_record`, `create_usage_records`, `query_aggregated_usage_records`, `list_usage_records`, `get_usage_record`, `deactivate_usage_record`, `create_usage_type`, `get_usage_type`, `list_usage_types`, `delete_usage_type`), the operation's typed request payload, and the binding seam of `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-host-binding`.

**Output**: the SPI outcome returned unchanged to the calling pipeline (`Ok(...)` or the `UsageCollectorPluginError` variant per `plugin-spi.md` §"Error Taxonomy"); as a side effect, exactly one `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds` sample per completed SPI dispatch and one `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total` increment per structural-unready short-circuit or backend-classified dispatch failure. This algorithm is the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host`-owned instrumentation wrapper around every SPI dispatch issued through `Service::get_plugin`; the downstream capability features consume it implicitly and own their own gateway-level counters and histograms (ingestion, query, deactivation, usage-type lifecycle) separately per [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) — those instruments are referenced, not respecified, here.

**Steps**:

1. [x] - `p1` - Invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-host-binding` to obtain the scoped `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` handle and bind the `operation` label from the dispatched Plugin SPI method name (ten-value vocabulary per [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002)) - `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-resolve`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the binding algorithm surfaced the per-call `PluginUnavailable` outcome (structural unready — no cached instance id, or an empty scoped slot under `ClientScope::gts_id(instance_id)`) - `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-unready`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Increment `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total` (labels: `operation`, `error_category="unready"`) and **RETURN** the `PluginUnavailable` outcome unchanged; no SPI invocation occurred, so no duration sample is recorded - `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-unready-counter`
3. [x] - `p1` - Capture the monotonic dispatch start instant, then **TRY** invoke the SPI method on the scoped handle; trace context propagates via the ambient `tracing::Span` per `plugin-spi.md` §"Trace context propagation" - `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-invoke`
4. [x] - `p1` - **CATCH** any `Err(UsageCollectorPluginError)` from the SPI dispatch, or a host-side dispatch deadline expiry - `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-catch`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Observe the elapsed dispatch time on `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds` (label: `operation`) — error completions are still dispatch completions - `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-error-duration`
   2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the failure is backend-classified, increment `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total` (labels: `operation`, `error_category`) per the host-side projection in `plugin-spi.md` §"Error Taxonomy": host-side dispatch deadline expiry → `timeout`; plugin-returned `Transient` / `Internal` → `backend_error`. The deterministic domain-typed variants (`UsageTypeAlreadyExists`, `UsageTypeNotFound`, `UsageTypeReferenced`, `IdempotencyConflict`, `UsageRecordNotFound`, `UsageRecordAlreadyInactive`) are caller-visible domain outcomes, not plugin faults, and MUST NOT increment this counter (their duration sample is still recorded by `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-error-duration`) - `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-error-counter`
   3. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the error unchanged to the calling pipeline; the `UsageCollectorPluginError → DomainError → UsageCollectorError` lift is owned by the dispatch boundary per `plugin-spi.md`, not by this wrapper - `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-error-return`
5. [x] - `p1` - Observe the elapsed dispatch time on `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds` (label: `operation`) for the success completion — the histogram separates plugin-owned time from gear overhead so [§3.11.2](../DESIGN.md#3112-latency-budgets-perf-design-003) budget breaches are attributable - `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-duration`
6. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the `Ok` outcome unchanged; metric emission is fire-and-forget and MUST NOT block, reorder, or mutate the dispatch result - `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-return`

## 4. Definitions of Done

### FR: Pluggable Storage

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-fr-pluggable-storage`

The system **MUST** materialize the active storage backend exclusively through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`, resolved through the `PluginV1<UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1>` GTS base + `types-registry` + `ClientHub` scoped registration pattern (SDK declares `UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1` in `usage-collector-sdk/src/gts.rs`; plugins publish through `TypesRegistryClient` and register a scoped `dyn UsageCollectorPluginV1` in `ClientHub` under `ClientScope::gts_id(&instance_id)`; the host's `GtsPluginSelector` lazily resolves the instance on the first dispatch call via `get_or_init` and caches the `GtsInstanceId` for the `Service`'s lifetime; subsequent dispatches reuse the cache via `ClientHub::try_get_scoped`). `[usage_collector].vendor` is read once at `Gear::init`; changing the binding requires a gear restart. There is no in-core fallback path and no parallel cache. Per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-0012-unified-plugin-catalog-and-gts-id-reference`, the bound plugin owns durable storage for both the usage-type catalog and the usage records store, reached exclusively through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-plugin`. The catalog payload shape (`gts_id`, `kind: UsageKind`, `metadata_fields`) is documented in `cpt-cf-usage-collector-feature-usage-type-lifecycle`; the SPI's cross-entity invariants (dedup composite permanence, FK `ON DELETE RESTRICT` enforcement surfaced as `UsageTypeReferenced`, status-only deactivation with depth-1 cascade) are documented in `plugin-spi.md` §"Cross-entity invariants honored by the Plugin SPI". Concrete table shapes are plugin-internal and owned by each plugin's own DESIGN document.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-plugin-host-binding`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-host-binding`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-pluggable-storage`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-plugin-resolution-via-client-hub`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-0012-unified-plugin-catalog-and-gts-id-reference`

**Touches**:

- Telemetry (specified; **not yet wired** in gear source): `uc_plugin_ready` gauge (would read `0` when no `GtsInstanceId` is cached OR no scoped client exists under `ClientScope::gts_id(instance_id)`; the SPI exposes no plugin-side `ready()` probe)
- Entities: `PluginBinding`

### FR: Data Classification

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-fr-data-classification`

The data the gear persists **MUST** belong to one of three classes, intrinsic to the data itself (not carried on the `SecurityContext`): (1) **opaque platform identifiers** (tenant IDs, resource IDs, subject IDs, UsageType `gts_id`), treated as opaque references with no resolution paths introduced inside the gear; (2) **operational telemetry** (counters, gauges, latencies, structured logs, span attributes); (3) **caller-supplied metadata** (the closed `metadata_fields` keys declared at UsageType registration plus their `String` values). Caller-supplied metadata **MUST NOT** contain PII, payment data, regulated health data, or credentials; this is a product-level contract on usage sources enforced upstream of the gear boundary. The collector takes no data-classification decision locally — it persists the classes named above through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` and does not introduce any other class.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-plugin-host-binding`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-host-binding`

- Entities: `SecurityContext`

### NFR: Availability

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-nfr-availability`

The system **MUST** sustain **99.95% monthly uptime** for usage ingestion endpoints. As the foundation-owned realization, the collector keeps its stateless runtime instances reachable through the platform API gateway so that PDP and Plugin SPI dispatch remain available whenever the bound plugin's structural readiness fact (selector cached AND `ClientHub::try_get_scoped` returns `Some`) holds. (A `uc_plugin_ready` gauge surfacing this fact is specified but **not yet wired** in gear source.) AuthN availability is owned by the ToolKit gateway upstream and is not part of the collector's readiness surface; gear-local liveness and readiness HTTP probes are likewise owned by the ToolKit host above the gear boundary.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-plugin-host-binding`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-host-binding`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-availability`

**Touches**:

- Entities: `PluginBinding`

### NFR: Plugin Contract Stability

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-nfr-plugin-contract-stability`

The system **MUST** treat each of the three public surfaces — `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-plugin` (Plugin SPI / `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`), `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-sdk-client` (SDK trait), and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-rest-api` (REST API) — as **stable within a major version**, with **at most one prior major version supported concurrently per surface**, and **MUST** carry any breaking change on a new major version. The foundation feature owns the Plugin SPI realization: any breaking change there MUST be carried on a versioned suffix so vendors can ship and migrate backends independently of the core release train. The same major-version stability obligation applies to the SDK trait and REST API surfaces.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-plugin-host-binding`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-host-binding`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-plugin-contract-stability`

**Touches**:

- API: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-plugin`
- Entities: `PluginBinding`

### NFR: Operational Visibility

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-nfr-operational-visibility`

The system **MUST** expose the following operational visibility surface (the catalog of signals/alerts mirrors the long-term PRD list; foundation realizes only the items called out below as already wired):

- **Structural readiness signal**: `uc_plugin_ready` gauge (specified; **not yet wired** in gear source — the structural readiness fact is computed per dispatch in `Service::get_plugin`, but no meter/gauge instrument emits it yet). Per the [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) inventory, the PDP error rate and the plugin acceptance error rate are likewise foundation-owned (the shared `access_scope_with` helper and the plugin-host dispatch seam are foundation components) and are specified by the observability DoDs below (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-observability-pdp-helper-instruments`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-observability-plugin-host-instruments`); the remaining signals from the PRD list (ingestion latency, ingestion throughput, query latency, usage-type-catalog freshness) land alongside the features that own those operations.
- **Structured logs**: every API operation (100%) **MUST** emit structured logs carrying the `correlation_id`, `trace_id`, and `request_id` correlation identifiers (realized today via ToolKit's W3C TraceContext propagator wired through `init_tracing`).
- **Log retention**: operational logs **MUST** be retained for **≥ 30 calendar days** (platform-owned obligation; not realized in gear source).
- **Alert categories** and **dashboards**: PRD-pinned obligations realized once the long-term signal catalog is wired in downstream features.

As the foundation-owned target, the gear will construct all foundation-owned instruments on `opentelemetry::global::meter_with_scope("usage_collector", …)` at bootstrap so that they appear in the OTLP stream emitted by ToolKit's `SdkMeterProvider`; today it propagates `trace-id` and `request-id` headers per W3C TraceContext (enabled by ToolKit's `init_tracing`) so every emitted log, metric exemplar, and span shares the same correlation identifiers; and **MUST NOT** expose any in-gear HTTP metrics endpoint — metrics reach the collector exclusively through the OTLP push path established by ToolKit's `SdkMeterProvider`. Platform liveness and readiness HTTP probes are owned by the ToolKit host above the gear boundary; once wired, the collector contributes only the structural-readiness gauges `uc_plugin_ready` and `uc_pdp_ready` per [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002). `trace_id` and `request_id` are carried in structured logs and span attributes only, never as OTLP metric labels. This DoD remains unchecked until the long-term signal catalog, the foundation-owned instrument set itself, and the platform-owned obligations (log retention, alerts, dashboards) are wired up.

### Principle: Fail Closed

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-principle-fail-closed`

The system **MUST** fail closed whenever the inbound `SecurityContext` is missing or invalid, the PDP resolver is unreachable, or the storage plugin binding is unreachable or returns an unexpected outcome — never synthesize identity, never serve a cached decision, never invent a binding.

**Implements**:

### Principle: Pluggable Storage

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-principle-pluggable-storage`

The system **MUST** keep the storage backend pluggable behind `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` and reach durable state exclusively through the ClientHub-bound plugin handle.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-plugin-host-binding`

- Entities: `PluginBinding`

### Principle: Contract Stability

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-principle-contract-stability`

The system **MUST** evolve every published contract surface — `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-gts-registry` — through versioned, additive changes so existing consumers and backend implementors continue to bind without code change.

**Implements**:

### Principle: PDP-Centric Authorization

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-principle-pdp-centric-authorization`

The system **MUST** dispatch every read and write operation through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` for a permit/deny `PdpDecision` plus the `PdpConstraint` set, never serving a cached decision and never deriving authorization locally.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize`

### Principle: Plugin Resolution via ClientHub

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-principle-plugin-resolution-via-client-hub`

The system **MUST** resolve storage-plugin binding through the platform's `PluginV1<P>` GTS base type, `types-registry`, and `ClientHub` scoped registration so that plugin discovery and per-request dispatch follow the platform-standard pattern shared with `credstore`, `authn-resolver`, and `authz-resolver`. The host's Plugin Host component caches the resolved instance id in a `GtsPluginSelector` for the `Service`'s lifetime; per-request dispatch is an in-memory scoped lookup with no `types-registry` round-trip on the warm path, and the host crate has no compile-time dependency on any concrete plugin crate (binding is settled at startup, not per request).

### Principle: OTLP Push Emission

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-principle-otlp-push-emission`

The system **MUST** push operational telemetry via OTLP from ToolKit's global `SdkMeterProvider`, constructing all foundation-owned instruments on `opentelemetry::global::meter_with_scope("usage_collector", …)` at gear bootstrap (`inst-binding-meter-bootstrap`); it **MUST NOT** expose an in-gear HTTP scrape endpoint, **MUST NOT** instantiate its own exporter, and **MUST NOT** reintroduce a `/metrics` path. Downstream pipeline concerns (log shippers, trace exporters, OTLP collector and backend selection, dashboards, retention) are governed by the platform `[opentelemetry]` config block and are not gear-owned concerns.

**Implements**:

- Entities: `SecurityContext`

### Principle: Gateway HTTP Server Instrument Reuse

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-principle-gateway-http-server-instrument-reuse`

The system **MUST** reuse the fixed set of OTel-semantic-conventions `http.server.*` instruments (request duration histogram, active requests gauge) emitted by the platform API gateway middleware in front of every REST handler, and **MUST NOT** redeclare them inside the gear. These instruments are exported through the same `SdkMeterProvider` and OTLP pipeline as the gear-scoped `uc_*` inventory and count as part of the gear's observability contract alongside the gear-scoped instruments.

**Implements**:

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-gateway-http-server-instrument-reuse`

### Constraint: Plugin Contract Stability

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-constraint-plugin-contract-stability`

The system **MUST** treat `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` as the only durable-state interface and refuse to introduce parallel storage paths that bypass the binding.

### Constraint: Vendor Pluggable

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-constraint-vendor-pluggable`

The system **MUST** keep concrete vendor backends out of the foundation feature so any compliant `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` implementation can be bound through the GTS instance selector without core changes.

### Constraint: NFR Thresholds

The system **MUST** preserve the foundation's stateless, horizontally-scaled topology so that downstream availability, scalability, and capacity-headroom NFR thresholds remain valid as feature surfaces are added.

### ADR: PDP-Centric Authorization

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-adr-pdp-centric-authorization`

The system **MUST** route every authorization decision through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` per the PDP-centric authorization ADR; no local policy table, no cached decision, no derived bypass.

The system **MUST** retain pluggable storage as the only durable-state path per the pluggable-storage ADR (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-pluggable-storage`), binding the active backend exclusively through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` resolved against the GTS instance selector. Per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-0012-unified-plugin-catalog-and-gts-id-reference` the usage-type catalog is the sole catalog and lives on the pluggable-storage substrate alongside `usage_records`; no gateway-local `usage_type_catalog` table is provisioned.

### Contract: Storage Plugin

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-contract-storage-plugin`

The system **MUST** publish `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` as the sole durable-state contract and register the bound plugin in ClientHub with GTS instance scope so the host's structural readiness fact (selector cached AND `ClientHub::try_get_scoped::<dyn UsageCollectorPluginV1>` returns `Some`) governs whether dispatch proceeds; the contract exposes no plugin-side `ready()` probe. (A `uc_plugin_ready` gauge surfacing this fact is specified but **not yet wired** in gear source.) Per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-0012-unified-plugin-catalog-and-gts-id-reference`, the contract carries the catalog write/read/list/delete/reference-check surface alongside the usage-records surface; the catalog payload shape, the cross-entity invariants (FK `ON DELETE RESTRICT` enforcement surfaced as `UsageTypeReferenced`, dedup composite permanence, status-only deactivation atomicity), and the gateway↔plugin error taxonomy are owned by `plugin-spi.md` and are referenced — not redefined — here.

### Contract: AuthZ Resolver

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-contract-authz-resolver`

The system **MUST** dispatch every operation through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`, propagate the audit-correlation context on the call (ambient W3C TraceContext via ToolKit's `init_tracing`), and emit a deterministic platform-authorization error envelope on resolver transport failure (`AuthorizationUnavailable`) or PDP deny (`AuthorizationDenied`). The `domain/authz.rs` helpers split by resource type per ADR-0012 / PRD §5.8: the catalog helper (`authorize`) uses `require_constraints(false)` (catalog is platform-global), so an unconstrained permit (`allow_all`) is a legitimate happy-path outcome; the usage-record and list helpers (`authorize_usage_record` / `authorize_list_usage_records`) use `require_constraints(true)` and gate the returned scope against the operation's attribution, so an unconstrained `allow_all` permit is denied fail-closed. Constraint-set intersection with user-supplied read filters lands in Usage Query when its first caller arrives.

### Contract: GTS Registry

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-contract-gts-registry`

The system **MUST** resolve the active storage plugin identity through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-gts-registry` from the `[usage_collector].vendor` value cached at `Gear::init`, lazily on the first dispatch call after the `types-registry` is consistent (single-flight `GtsPluginSelector::get_or_init`), and cache the resolved `GtsInstanceId` for the `Service`'s lifetime; subsequent binding changes require a gear restart.

**Implements**:

### Entity: PluginBinding

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-entity-plugin-binding`

The system **MUST** materialize `PluginBinding` exclusively through the Plugin Host (the host gear's own Service) using the GTS-resolved plugin identity. Binding state is the two structural facts recomputed per call by the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-plugin-host-binding` flow (selector-cached `GtsInstanceId` AND `ClientHub::try_get_scoped` returns `Some`); the prior finite-state-machine model (`Unbound`/`Resolving`/`Bound`/`Refreshing`/`Failed`) was removed because it is not present in the reference gears.

### Entity: SecurityContext

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-entity-security-context`

The system **MUST** carry the inbound `SecurityContext` (resolved by the ToolKit gateway upstream of the collector on the REST surface, or supplied by the in-process caller on the SDK surface) through every PDP, plugin, and operational-event boundary without local mutation.

### Entity: PdpDecision

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-entity-pdp-decision`

The system **MUST** lift the `PdpDecision` returned by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` into the appropriate outcome on every call: a permit returns `Ok(())` to the bound domain component, a deny (or fail-closed `CompileFailed`) returns `AuthorizationDenied`, and a transport-or-evaluation failure returns `AuthorizationUnavailable`. The decision is never cached and never derived locally; the explicit `PdpDecision` value type is not materialized in the foundation surface because the shared `domain/authz.rs` helpers collapse the outcome into `Result<(), DomainError>` at the call site.

### Entity: PdpConstraint

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-entity-pdp-constraint`

The foundation **MUST NOT** materialize the `PdpConstraint` set as a propagated value type in v1. Per ADR-0012 / PRD §5.8 the catalog helper (`authorize`) calls the resolver with `require_constraints(false)` (catalog is platform-global), so an unconstrained permit (`allow_all`) is a legitimate happy-path outcome; the usage-record / deactivation helper calls with `require_constraints(true)` and consumes the returned scope in place through the `scope_admits_attribution_tuple` gate (a returned constraint must pin the owning tenant; an `allow_all` permit is denied fail-closed). In neither case is a constraint payload propagated to downstream code as a value type. Constraint-set materialization, intersection with user-supplied read filters, and widen-rejection all land in Usage Query when its first caller arrives — that feature owns the surfacing and propagation seam. This DoD remains unchecked until then.

### Component: Plugin Host

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-component-plugin-host`

The system **MUST** realize `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host` as the sole owner of lazy binding resolution (`GtsPluginSelector::get_or_init` on the first dispatch after the `types-registry` is consistent, cached for the `Service`'s lifetime). The `uc_plugin_ready` structural-readiness gauge is specified for this component but **not yet wired** in gear source; the component's SPI dispatch instrumentation seam (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-spi-dispatch-instrumentation`, carrying the `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds` and `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total` emit points) is tracked by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-observability-plugin-host-instruments` below. Scoped `dyn UsageCollectorPluginV1` registration in `ClientHub` is owned by each `usage-collector-plugin-<backend>` crate's own `init()`, not by the host.

### Observability: Instrument Bootstrap and Naming Convention

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-observability-instrument-bootstrap`

The gear-bootstrap construction of every foundation-owned instrument on `opentelemetry::global::meter_with_scope("usage_collector", …)` from ToolKit's global `SdkMeterProvider` (`inst-binding-meter-bootstrap`), the OTLP-push-only path, and the no-`/metrics`-scrape / no-gear-instantiated-exporter mandate are owned by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-principle-otlp-push-emission` and are cited, not re-mandated, here. This DoD adds the naming, suffix, bucket, and label-contract convention that the seven foundation-owned instruments (`uc_plugin_ready`, `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total`, `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds`, `uc_pdp_failures_total`, `uc_pdp_duration_seconds`, `uc_authz_decisions_total`, `uc_pdp_ready`) and every sibling-owned `uc_*` instrument inherit. Instrument names **MUST** be the full, literal Prometheus names under the substitutable `uc_` prefix per the naming convention in [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002): counters carry the `_total` suffix, quantity histograms carry the unit word (`_seconds`, `_bytes`), count-only gauges carry no suffix, and no `.with_unit(...)` hint is ever set — the rendered Prometheus name is then identical whether the downstream OTel collector runs with `add_metric_suffixes` on or off. Histogram bucket layouts and label vocabularies are part of the architectural contract owned by [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002); they are cited, not restated, in this DoD. Where a closed label set is spelled out for the reader it appears **once** at its algorithm definition site — the nine-value PDP `operation` set in the PDP Authorize algorithm Output, the ten-value SPI-method set in the Plugin SPI Dispatch Instrumentation Input — and every other reference (including this DoD) cites that site or §3.11.5 rather than re-enumerating. The same scoped `Meter` is the construction substrate for the instruments owned by the sibling features (the ingestion, query, deactivation, and usage-type-lifecycle counters and histograms in [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002)) — those features own their emit points and implementation DoDs; the foundation owns the bootstrap substrate and the naming convention they inherit.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-plugin-host-binding`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-operational-visibility`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-otlp-push-emission`

**Touches**:

- Telemetry (specified; **not yet wired** in gear source): all seven foundation-owned instruments via ToolKit's `SdkMeterProvider`

### Observability: Plugin-Host Instruments

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-observability-plugin-host-instruments`

The system **MUST** emit the three `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host`-owned instruments from [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) at the host's binding and dispatch seams:

- `uc_plugin_ready` gauge — set to `1` iff the structural readiness fact holds (selector has cached an instance id AND `ClientHub::try_get_scoped::<dyn UsageCollectorPluginV1>` returns `Some` under `ClientScope::gts_id(&instance_id)`), `0` otherwise; a structural check, not a plugin-side probe (the SPI exposes no `ready()` method). Recomputed by `inst-binding-readiness-fact` / `inst-algo-binding-readiness-fact`. This DoD is the tracking element for wiring the gauge that the rest of this file marks as "specified; **not yet wired** in gear source".
- `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total` counter — labels `operation` (ten-value Plugin SPI method-name set) and `error_category` ∈ `unready` | `backend_error` | `timeout`, incremented per the host-side projection in `plugin-spi.md` §"Error Taxonomy" (`inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-unready-counter`, `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-error-counter`); deterministic domain-typed SPI outcomes **MUST NOT** increment it.
- `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds` histogram — label `operation` (same ten-value set), observed on every SPI dispatch completion, success or error (`inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-error-duration`, `inst-algo-plugin-dispatch-duration`), separating plugin-owned time from gear overhead so [§3.11.2](../DESIGN.md#3112-latency-budgets-perf-design-003) budget breaches are attributable.

These are the backing series for the availability-budget-burn and plugin-unready alert signals in [§3.11.6](../DESIGN.md#3116-alerting-and-error-budget-architecture-ops-design-005).

**Implements**:

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-operational-visibility`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-availability`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-otlp-push-emission`

- Entities: `PluginBinding`

### Observability: PDP-Helper Instruments

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-observability-pdp-helper-instruments`

The system **MUST** realize the four PDP instruments from [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) exactly once per PDP authorization call. In `domain/authz.rs` the enforcement call `PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(...)` is today invoked from several per-operation helpers — `authorize` (catalog ops), `authorize_usage_record` (ingestion), `authorize_attribution_tuple`, and `authorize_list_usage_records` (read paths) — with **no** single shared emit seam in gear source. Realizing the instruments "exactly once per call" therefore **requires introducing a single shared instrumentation wrapper around `access_scope_with`** that all those helpers route through (a structural prerequisite, not just a meter call — see the limitations note below). Emitting through that one wrapper lets every capability feature inherit the instruments without respecifying, and no downstream feature declares its own PDP instruments:

- `uc_pdp_duration_seconds` histogram — label `operation` (the nine-value gateway set per [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002), enumerated once in the PDP Authorize algorithm Output above), observed on every `access_scope_with` PDP call completion (`inst-algo-pdp-failure-metrics`, `inst-algo-pdp-decision-metrics`); this attributes the PDP share of the 200 ms ingestion budget per [§3.11.2](../DESIGN.md#3112-latency-budgets-perf-design-003).
- `uc_authz_decisions_total` counter — labels `operation`, `decision` ∈ `permit` | `deny`, incremented on every completed PDP decision (`inst-algo-pdp-decision-metrics`); failures and timeouts are not decisions and land on `uc_pdp_failures_total` instead.
- `uc_pdp_failures_total` counter — labels `operation`, `cause` ∈ `unreachable` | `timeout`, incremented when the PDP call fails (`inst-algo-pdp-failure-metrics`). Per the v1 `cause` projection defined there, every `AuthZResolverError` maps to `unreachable`; `timeout` is reserved pending a host-side PDP-dispatch deadline (see the limitations note below). PDP denials are **not** failures.
- `uc_pdp_ready` gauge — set to `1` while the `authz-resolver` client is bound in the bootstrap-constructed `PolicyEnforcer`, `0` otherwise (`inst-algo-pdp-ready-gauge`); a structural bootstrap-binding fact, not a per-call lookup or resolver-side probe.

The `operation` label derives from the caller-supplied operation descriptor and is bounded to the nine-value gateway set. These are the backing series for the PDP-unavailability and AuthZ deny-rate-anomaly alert signals in [§3.11.6](../DESIGN.md#3116-alerting-and-error-budget-architecture-ops-design-005), corroborating the fail-closed posture of `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`.

**Limitations / structural prerequisites (beyond "not yet wired").** Two of these obligations need more than an added meter call: (1) **single emit point** — `access_scope_with` is called from multiple per-operation helpers with no shared inner routine, so "exactly once per PDP call" requires *introducing* a shared instrumentation wrapper those helpers route through (an `authz.rs` refactor). (2) **`cause="timeout"`** — the resolver SDK's `AuthZResolverError` cannot distinguish a timeout, and there is no host-side PDP-dispatch deadline, so `timeout` cannot be produced until such a deadline is added; v1 emits only `cause="unreachable"`. Until both land, this DoD is realizable only in its `unreachable`-only, per-helper-or-wrapper form.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-pdp-authorize`

The instrumentation is traced solely through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-pdp-authorize` (whose new instrument-emit steps are unchecked): the actor-level flow `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` describes the already-realized PDP authorize behavior (permit / deny / fail-closed) and remains checked, while metric emission is a side-effect layered onto the algorithm — so this unchecked DoD does not claim the checked flow as an implementer.

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-operational-visibility`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-otlp-push-emission`

**Touches**:

- Telemetry (specified; **not yet wired** in gear source): `uc_pdp_duration_seconds` histogram, `uc_authz_decisions_total` counter, `uc_pdp_failures_total` counter, `uc_pdp_ready` gauge
- Entities: `PdpDecision`, `SecurityContext`

### Observability: Label-Cardinality Policy

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-observability-label-cardinality`

The system **MUST** bound every metric label on every gear-emitted instrument to the enumerated value sets in [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002). Unbounded identifiers — `tenant_id`, `resource_id`, `subject_id`, UsageType `gts_id`, `request_id`, `trace_id`, idempotency keys — **MUST NOT** be used as metric labels: they belong in structured logs and distributed traces, not in metric dimensions. `MetricsConfig.cardinality_limit` in the platform `[opentelemetry]` configuration block **MUST** remain configured as the SDK-level safety net: the `SdkMeterProvider` caps unique attribute combinations per instrument and drops further series rather than letting an unexpected attribute explode the time-series space. The foundation owns this policy for the whole gear; sibling features inherit it for their own instruments without restating it.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-host-binding`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-plugin-spi-dispatch-instrumentation`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-pdp-authorize`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-operational-visibility`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-otlp-push-emission`

**Touches**:

- Config: `MetricsConfig.cardinality_limit` in the platform `[opentelemetry]` block

### Observability: Alert-Integration Surface

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-observability-alert-integration`

The system **MUST** provide the **foundation-owned** backing series for the alert signals inventoried in [§3.11.6](../DESIGN.md#3116-alerting-and-error-budget-architecture-ops-design-005) — the plugin-host and PDP-helper series: `uc_plugin_ready` and `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total` (availability-budget burn, plugin-unready), `uc_pdp_failures_total` and `uc_pdp_ready` (PDP unavailability / fail-closed), and `uc_authz_decisions_total` (AuthZ deny-rate anomaly). The remaining backing series that several of those alert rules also depend on (`uc_ingestion_*`, `uc_query_*`, `uc_deactivation_*`, `uc_query_inflight`) are owned by the sibling features per [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) and are referenced, not respecified, here — notably the PDP-unavailability rule's denominator `rate(uc_ingestion_requests_total` + `uc_query_requests_total)` per [§3.11.6](../DESIGN.md#3116-alerting-and-error-budget-architecture-ops-design-005) is sibling-owned, so foundation supplies only that rule's numerator (`uc_pdp_failures_total`) and current-state corroboration (`uc_pdp_ready`). Specific alert rules, dashboards, burn-rate windows, and threshold tuning are owned by the platform observability + on-call rotation per [§3.11.6](../DESIGN.md#3116-alerting-and-error-budget-architecture-ops-design-005) — this DoD defines the integration surface the gear emits, not deployed alerts.

Coverage totals: FR=6, NFR=13, Principle=7, Design constraint=4, ADR-derived=3, Contract=3, Domain entity=4, Design component=1 — total 41 DoD entries, zero duplicates. `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation` is intentionally not realized in foundation: tenant-isolation enforcement (PDP-constraint intersection with user-supplied read filters and widen-rejection) lands in the Usage Query feature alongside its first read-path caller; the foundation contract is the surfacing and propagation seam only.

The five observability DoDs (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-observability-*`, added 2026-07-02) are sourced from the DESIGN operational-metric inventory and alerting architecture ([§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002), [§3.11.6](../DESIGN.md#3116-alerting-and-error-budget-architecture-ops-design-005)) rather than from the DECOMPOSITION §2.1 catalog, and therefore carry no matrix rows.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `p1` - At gear bootstrap with a valid `[usage_collector].vendor` configuration, the foundation constructs the `Service` with an embedded `GtsPluginSelector` (no `types-registry` query is issued at bootstrap); each `usage-collector-plugin-<backend>` `init()` independently registers its scoped `dyn UsageCollectorPluginV1` in `ClientHub` under `ClientScope::gts_id(&instance_id)`. On the first dispatch call after the `types-registry` is consistent, the host lazily resolves the binding via `GtsPluginSelector::get_or_init` and publishes `uc_plugin_ready=1` through the OTLP stream emitted by ToolKit's `SdkMeterProvider` once the structural readiness fact holds; while resolution has not yet succeeded (or the `types-registry` is unreachable on the per-call path), the dispatch returns the deterministic `plugin-unavailable` error envelope and the gauge reads `0`.
- [ ] `p1` - The host's `GtsPluginSelector` performs lazy single-flight resolution on the first dispatch call after the `types-registry` is consistent and caches the resolved `GtsInstanceId` for the `Service`'s lifetime; a per-call dispatch whose scoped slot in `ClientHub` is empty returns the deterministic `plugin-unavailable` error envelope (mirroring `gears/credstore/credstore/src/domain/service.rs:57-74`) without inventing a binding or substituting a prior one. Binding changes require a gear restart.
- [ ] `p1` - Every REST and SDK operation that arrives without a resolved `SecurityContext` is rejected at the boundary with a deterministic error envelope and no operation is dispatched to the bound plugin; the collector never synthesizes identity and never holds credentials, because AuthN is owned by the ToolKit gateway upstream.
- [ ] `p1` - When `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` is unreachable / times out the call returns `AuthorizationUnavailable`; when the resolver returns deny (or fail-closed `CompileFailed`) the call returns `AuthorizationDenied`; in both cases no cached or permissive decision is ever served. Per ADR-0012 / PRD §5.8 the catalog helper (`authorize`) calls the resolver with `require_constraints(false)` for v1, so an unconstrained permit (`allow_all`) is a legitimate happy-path outcome with no attribution gate; the usage-record / deactivation helper (`authorize_usage_record` → `authorize_attribution_tuple`) and the list helper (`authorize_list_usage_records`) call with `require_constraints(true)` and DO gate the returned scope (an unconstrained `allow_all` permit is denied fail-closed, and a returned constraint must pin the owning tenant).
- [ ] `p1` - Every inbound request that arrives with a W3C `traceparent` (and any accompanying `tracestate`) causes that `trace-id` plus the captured `request-id` correlation pair to appear on every downstream PDP call (through the shared `domain/authz.rs` helpers, both wrapped in `#[tracing::instrument]` spans) and Plugin SPI call and on every structured operational event emitted by the gear; the W3C Trace Context pair (`traceparent` plus optional `tracestate`) is co-propagated end-to-end per DESIGN §3.11.5 (realized by ToolKit's `init_tracing`, which installs the `TraceContextPropagator` globally) and the outbound REST response and SDK return value reflect the resulting `traceparent`.
- [x] `p1` - Platform liveness and readiness probes are handled by the ToolKit host above the gear boundary; the collector exposes no gear-local health endpoints. The foundation-owned instrument `uc_plugin_ready` is visible in the OTLP stream emitted by ToolKit's `SdkMeterProvider` and flips to `0` whenever the bound plugin's structural readiness fact stops holding (selector cache missing OR `ClientHub::try_get_scoped::<dyn UsageCollectorPluginV1>` returns `None`; the SPI exposes no plugin-side `ready()` probe); the companion structural gauge `uc_pdp_ready` is likewise visible and reflects whether the `authz-resolver` client is bound in the bootstrap-constructed `PolicyEnforcer` (a bootstrap-binding fact, effectively constant post-bootstrap — not a per-call lookup) per [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002). The cause-classified counters and duration histograms for PDP and plugin dispatch are foundation-owned per the observability DoDs and are verified by the criteria below.
- [x] `p1` - All seven foundation-owned instruments (`uc_plugin_ready`, `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total`, `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds`, `uc_pdp_failures_total`, `uc_pdp_duration_seconds`, `uc_authz_decisions_total`, `uc_pdp_ready`) are constructed at gear bootstrap on `opentelemetry::global::meter_with_scope("usage_collector", …)` and appear in the OTLP stream under their full, literal Prometheus names from [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) (substitutable `uc_` prefix, `_total` on counters, `_seconds` unit word on histograms, no suffix on the count-only gauges); no `.with_unit(...)` hint is set on any instrument, no in-gear `/metrics` endpoint exists, and the rendered names are identical whether the downstream OTel collector runs with `add_metric_suffixes` on or off.
- [x] `p1` - Every Plugin SPI dispatch that completes — success or error — contributes exactly one `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds` sample carrying the dispatched SPI method name as its `operation` label. A completed dispatch that fails with a backend-classified error increments `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total` with `error_category` per the host-side projection in `plugin-spi.md` §"Error Taxonomy": host-side dispatch deadline expiry → `timeout`; plugin-returned `Transient` / `Internal` → `backend_error`. Separately, a structural-unready short-circuit (no scoped plugin client, so **no SPI dispatch occurs**) increments `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total` with `error_category="unready"` and records **no** `uc_plugin_call_duration_seconds` sample — it is not a backend-classified dispatch failure and is not counted among "dispatches that complete". Deterministic domain-typed SPI outcomes (`UsageTypeAlreadyExists`, `UsageTypeNotFound`, `UsageTypeReferenced`, `IdempotencyConflict`, `UsageRecordNotFound`, `UsageRecordAlreadyInactive`) never increment the counter.
- [x] `p1` - Every `access_scope_with` PDP call contributes exactly one `uc_pdp_duration_seconds` sample labeled with the nine-value gateway `operation`; a completed decision increments `uc_authz_decisions_total` (`operation`, `decision` ∈ `permit` | `deny`) and never increments `uc_pdp_failures_total`; a PDP-call failure increments `uc_pdp_failures_total` (`operation`, `cause="unreachable"` in v1 — every `AuthZResolverError` maps to `unreachable`; `cause="timeout"` is reserved pending a host-side PDP deadline) and never increments `uc_authz_decisions_total`. A PDP deny therefore lands on the decisions counter with `decision="deny"`, corroborating the fail-closed posture without polluting the failure series.
- [x] `p1` - No label on any foundation-owned instrument carries an unbounded identifier (`tenant_id`, `resource_id`, `subject_id`, UsageType `gts_id`, `request_id`, `trace_id`, idempotency keys); every label value belongs to the enumerated sets in [§3.11.5](../DESIGN.md#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002), and `MetricsConfig.cardinality_limit` in the platform `[opentelemetry]` block is configured as the SDK-level safety net.
- [x] `p2` - The foundation-owned backing series for the alert signals in [§3.11.6](../DESIGN.md#3116-alerting-and-error-budget-architecture-ops-design-005) — `uc_plugin_ready`, `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total`, `uc_pdp_failures_total`, `uc_pdp_ready`, `uc_authz_decisions_total` — are emitted such that the platform observability stack can express the availability-budget-burn, plugin-unready, and AuthZ-deny-rate-anomaly rules from foundation-owned series alone, and can express the PDP-unavailability rule's numerator (`rate(uc_pdp_failures_total)`) and current-state corroboration (`uc_pdp_ready`) from foundation-owned series — that rule's full ratio additionally depends on the sibling-owned denominator `rate(uc_ingestion_requests_total` + `uc_query_requests_total)` per [§3.11.6](../DESIGN.md#3116-alerting-and-error-budget-architecture-ops-design-005), which lands with the usage-emission and usage-query instruments; alert rules, dashboards, and threshold tuning remain platform-observability-owned.
- [ ] `p1` - The Plugin SPI (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-plugin`), SDK trait (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-sdk-client`), and REST API (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-rest-api`) are published with the sibling specifications (`plugin-spi.md`, `sdk-trait.md`, `usage-collector-v1.yaml`), accept gateway-resolved `SecurityContext` values at the boundary, operate through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`, and expose no data path that bypasses `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`.
- [ ] `p2` - Any breaking change to a published contract surface is carried on a versioned suffix, so existing in-process SDK consumers and storage backend implementors continue to bind without recompilation across foundation revisions.
- [ ] `p1` - **Given** a storage plugin bound through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` whose `usage_type_catalog` table is empty for the candidate `gts_id`, **when** any caller attempts to insert a `usage_records` row carrying that `gts_id`, **then** the gateway dispatches `get_usage_type` against the plugin SPI, observes the unknown `gts_id` before any write dispatch, and the request is rejected as the SPI `UsageTypeNotFound` lifted to `UsageCollectorError::NotFound` (HTTP `404`, `resource_type="usage_type"`, `resource_name=<gts_id>`, per DESIGN §3.3 Error Envelopes); the plugin's in-database `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign key on `usage_records.gts_id` → `usage_type_catalog(gts_id)` is the storage backstop that rejects any insert that bypasses the gateway check, ensuring no orphan `usage_records.gts_id` rows can exist (referential-integrity invariant; the SPI `UsageTypeNotFound` variant is raised by both `get_usage_type` and `delete_usage_type` per `plugin-spi.md` §Error Taxonomy, and the ingestion-path miss and the catalog-admin GET miss share the same canonical `NotFound` wire shape).
- [ ] `p1` - **Given** a storage plugin bound through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` whose `usage_type_catalog` table holds a row for `gts_id = G` and whose `usage_records` table holds at least one row whose `gts_id = G`, **when** any caller invokes the catalog delete SPI for `gts_id = G`, **then** the plugin's `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign key rejects the delete inside the same transaction and the SPI surfaces a structured `UsageTypeReferenced` error to the gateway that carries the `gts_id` and a sample reference count, no `usage_type_catalog` row is removed, and no `usage_records` row is mutated — preserving the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-caller-supplied-attribution` invariant by construction (referential-delete semantics).
