**ID**: `cpt-cf-credstore-adr-value-fingerprint-fence`

## Context and Problem Statement

With a stateful gateway (ADR-0001) a write spans two stores with no shared
transaction: the value goes to the external value-store backend
(`plugin.put`), the metadata (`sharing`, `version`, `expires_at`) to
`credstore_secrets` (`touch`). On the last-writer-wins path (no `If-Match`)
both a backend write and a metadata write happen, so two concurrent PUTs to
one reference can interleave crosswise:

```
Alice: PUT value=A, sharing=shared     Bob: PUT value=B, sharing=tenant
  plugin.put(A)                           plugin.put(B)   → backend = B
  touch(sharing=shared)                   touch(sharing=tenant)
  # commit order: put(A), put(B), touch(Bob=tenant), touch(Alice=shared)
  # end state:   backend = B             row.sharing = shared
```

A descendant tenant then resolves Bob's value under Alice's `shared` label —
a durable cross-tenant disclosure of a secret its writer marked tenant-only
(review finding #2). Independently, the `ETag` was the bare `version`
counter, which restarts at `1` for every recreated row, so a stale client's
`If-Match: "1"` matched a *different generation* and overwrote it — the ABA
lost update the strong validator exists to prevent (finding #1).

The platform's coordination primitives are explicitly not built to fence
this: the cluster distributed lock has **no fencing tokens** and forbids
remote I/O inside a lock's critical section (cluster ADR-002), and the
`coord` DB-lease documents the same non-guarantee for external side effects.
How do we make the metadata and the value provably consistent on read
without holding a lock across the backend write, and without a bare-version
validator?

## Decision Drivers

* No value under a sharing label a different writer set — fail closed, never disclose
* Correct across replicas (the gateway is multi-instance) without new infrastructure
* Do not hold any lock across the external `plugin.put` (cluster ADR-002)
* Nothing derived from a secret value may leave the gateway (no fingerprint on the wire, in headers, or in logs)
* The backend stays an opaque byte store — the same mechanism works for the in-memory static plugin and any future vault-backed plugin, with no plugin-contract change
* Close the ABA lost update in the same change
* Fail-closed and self-healing under every partial-failure and key-loss mode

## Considered Options

* Serialize writers with a distributed lock (cluster / `coord`)
* `SERIALIZABLE` isolation on the metadata write
* Stamp the version into the backend value (inline framing) or backend key
* Value fingerprint (`HMAC-SHA256(fence_key, value)`) in the gateway row, verified on read

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"Value fingerprint in the gateway row"**. Each row stores
`value_fp = HMAC-SHA256(fence_key, value)`, stamped in the same atomic
`touch`/insert as `sharing`; reads recompute it from the value the backend
returned and serve only on a match, else fail closed as an anti-enumeration
404. The atomic co-write of `value_fp` and `sharing` is what proves a matched
value and its metadata came from one writer. The fence key is auto-generated
and stored in the backend under a reserved, API-unreachable entry (split
knowledge: fingerprints in the DB, key with the values). The `ETag` becomes
the generation-bound pair `"<row-id>.<version>"`, closing the ABA. This is
precisely the application-level fencing cluster ADR-002 prescribes for an
"external storage layer with fencing support" — here the gateway supplies
that support on the backend's behalf. See §4.10 of DESIGN.

### Consequences

* A crosswise LWW interleave, a half-completed overwrite, or a lost/replaced fence key can only ever produce a fingerprint mismatch → 404, healed by any subsequent successful PUT. No state serves a value under mismatched metadata.
* LWW is no longer strict last-writer-wins under a same-value/different-sharing race: the loser's intent can be lost. This is not a disclosure — a served value's sharing label was set by the writer of *that* value (the atomic co-write), so no value is ever exposed under a sharing nobody assigned it.
* Backend value bytes and the plugin contract are unchanged; a future vault-backed plugin needs no fencing support of its own.
* A value-derived artifact (the keyed HMAC) now lives at rest in the gateway DB. It never leaves the gateway, and the HMAC key (not in the DB) blocks offline dictionary attack on a DB-only compromise.
* A new dependency surface: the fence key must be reachable at write/read time. Its outage coincides with a backend outage (same store), which already fails the operation; a lost/rotated key fails closed (loud `fence_verify{outcome="mismatch"}`) and re-PUT heals.
* Out-of-band DB seeding must set `value_fp = NULL` (and reset it on re-seed); such rows are served on trust and backfilled on first read / reaper sweep.
* Key rotation is out of scope; the `fp_key_id` column and reserved-reference naming are the groundwork (a keyring verified by id, lazy re-stamp) for a later change.

### Confirmation

* Unit test: the poisoned crosswise end-state (backend value ≠ row fingerprint) reads as a 404, and a subsequent PUT heals it.
* Unit + e2e: a recreated secret rejects the previous generation's `"<id>.<version>"` validator (409) even though the version counters coincide.
* Unit: an out-of-band `value_fp = NULL` row serves on trust, backfills exactly once via a CAS that does not bump the version, then verifies `ok`.
* Unit: fence-key bootstrap persists the key under the reserved nil-tenant entry; a tenant PUT to the same reference never clobbers it and cannot resolve it.
* Unit: a stale cached key self-heals via the one-shot refresh on mismatch.
* Metrics: `fence_verify{ok|legacy|mismatch}` and `fence_backfill{...}` are emitted with the documented labels.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Serialize writers with a distributed lock

Hold a cluster / `coord` lock per `(tenant, ref)` across `plugin.put` + `touch`.

* Bad, because both primitives forbid exactly this (no remote I/O in a lock critical section; no fencing tokens — cluster ADR-002), so a TTL-preempted holder still races.
* Bad, because it needs shared infrastructure (a linearizable cache / DB-lease table) and a per-write acquire on the hot path.
* Bad, because even a perfect lock cannot make a two-store write atomic; a pause between the two writes still desyncs.

### `SERIALIZABLE` isolation on the metadata write

* Bad, because isolation only serializes operations *within* the DB; the external `plugin.put` is outside any transaction, so the value/metadata desync is untouched.
* Bad, because holding a transaction open across the backend network call is a long-transaction anti-pattern and still does not order the external write.

### Stamp the version into the backend value / key

Inline-frame `magic‖version‖value`, or route each version to a distinct backend key.

* Good, because it is airtight and keeps no value-derived data in the DB.
* Bad, because it mutates the stored secret (a direct backend reader sees framed bytes) or changes the key scheme and accumulates old-version values needing GC.
* Bad, because "is there a stamp?" becomes byte-sniffing a magic prefix (collision-prone) instead of a clean typed check; and for a structured backend (e.g. OpenBao KV) it either mangles the value field or needs a plugin-contract change.

### Value fingerprint in the gateway row (CHOSEN)

* Good, because the backend and the plugin contract are untouched — one mechanism for every backend.
* Good, because verification is a clean recompute-and-compare, and "unstamped" is a NULL column, not a guessed prefix.
* Good, because it is the exact pattern cluster ADR-002 points external-resource fencing to (application-level), and it closes the ABA in the same `ETag` change.
* Neutral, because it stores a keyed HMAC of the value at rest — mitigated by keying and by never exposing it.
* Bad (accepted), because it does not preserve strict LWW under a same-value/different-sharing race (a lost update, never a disclosure).

- Supersedes the bare-version `ETag` described in earlier revisions of DESIGN §4.3; builds on the dual-write model of ADR-0001 / ADR-0002.
