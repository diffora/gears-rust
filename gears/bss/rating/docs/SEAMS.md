## A. Canonical scope key & resolution order

| # | Sev | Verdict | Seam |
|---|-----|---------|------|
| **K1** | CRIT | T-adopts | **Step-2 selection key is 4-axis, owner's is 8-axis.** Tariffs selects on `(planId, currency, region, phase)[+priceOverlay]` and asserts "at most one window MUST match" (T:125, T:447). Pricing's canonical key is 8 additive axes `(planId, currency, region, priceOverlay, phase, priceEligibility, chargeKind, cohort)` (`design/01:321`), and it *deliberately* publishes many concurrently-active rows on the shorter tuple (hybrid chargeKinds; grandfathered generations + successor). Tariffs' "one match" fails-closed on exactly the legitimate catalogs pricing engineered. → Tariffs adopts the 8-column non-overlap/selection key verbatim (already a cross-team obligation: `ADR/0002:75`, `ADR/0001:102`). |
| **K2** | CRIT | T-adopts | **cohort / multi-generation grandfathering absent.** Tariffs models a *flat* `existing_grandfathered` (activated-before-cutover, T:521). Pricing's ADR-0002/D-02: N generations coexist, each an active window; Tariffs must select the row whose `cohort` = the cohort of the subscription's **pinned price id** in `pricingSnapshotRef` (`ADR/0002:69`, `design/07:232`). No new store — the pin already exists. → Tariffs adds class-then-cohort within-class selection. |
| **K3** | HIGH | T-adopts | **`chargeKind` is not a selection axis.** Recurring and usage rows differ *only* by `chargeKind`; without it in the key, step-2 selection is non-unique (T:413 knows hybrid emits two lines but never keys on it). Pricing: `chargeKind ∈ {recurring, usage, one_time, one_time_setup}` is column-6 (`design/01:326`). → include `chargeKind` in the step-2 key; each emitted line resolves its own row. |
| **K4** | MED | T-adopts | **Eligibility class order unstated.** Pricing: `existing_grandfathered > new_subscriptions_only > all_subscriptions`, class ordering only (`design/07:111/231`). Tariffs implies precedence but never states the total order. → state it as the step-2 tie-break (pairs with K1/K2). |
| **K5** | MED | T-adopts | **`phase` axis typing drift.** Tariffs refers to phase by kind-name (trial/intro/evergreen, T:531). Pricing D-19: `phase` axis is always a `phase_id` (uuid); non-phased/one-time rows ride an implicit **terminal `phase_id`** (`design/01:324`). A name-based match won't join the uuid axis. → specify `phase` as `phase_id`; kind names are display only. |

## B. Overlays / PriceOverlay precedence

| # | Sev | Verdict | Seam |
|---|-----|---------|------|
| **O1** | HIGH | T-adopts | **Cross-class tie-break uses `priceOverlayId`; owner mandates class-specificity order.** Tariffs: ascending `precedence` then ascending `priceOverlayId` (T:479). Pricing: `precedence` is unique only *within* a class; cross-class ties resolve by `customerGroup > partner > orgTier > brand > region > global`, which "Tariffs MUST adopt verbatim" (`design/09:184`). → replace the `priceOverlayId` cross-class tie-break with the class order. |
| **O2** | HIGH | T-adopts | **`customerGroup` scope class missing.** Tariffs scope enum = `{partner, orgTier, brand, region, global}` (T:126). Pricing adds `customerGroup` as a first-class, server-resolved segment overlay and the *most-specific* class (`design/09:181/184`). → add `customerGroup` to the step-4 scope mapping (matches payer's BSS-resolved group at `t`). |
| **O3** | HIGH | **RESOLVED → stack** | **Stack-all vs single-winner at step 4.** Tariffs *stacks* all scope-matching survivors sequentially (T:479); pricing frames overlay resolution as most-specific-*winner*. **Decision (2026-07-10):** step 4 **stacks** all survivors (partner + brand + region overlays are legitimately cumulative). Pricing's "most-specific-wins" governs (a) `priceEligibility` *class* selection and (b) *ties at equal precedence* — NOT overlay exclusivity. The class-specificity order (O1) is the tie-break within the stack, not a winner-take-all filter. Pricing to confirm its wording reads as tie-break, not exclusivity (expected already true). |

## C. PriceWindow ownership & events

| # | Sev | Verdict | Seam |
|---|-----|---------|------|
| **W0** | — | ALIGNED | **Marquee ownership (D-03/ADR-0003): no conflict.** Tariffs treats PriceWindows as externally-owned read-only inputs — Catalog/Price-Book is "SoR for … PriceWindow; emits schedule-change events" and Tariffs "MUST consume PriceWindow* events" (T:212/261). Pricing (Slice 7) owns the store, state machine, activation job, and event production (`ADR/0003:72`). The pricing gear *is* the Catalog/Price-Book SoR Tariffs references. |
| **W1** | HIGH | T-adopts | **`PriceWindowCancelled` not consumed.** Pricing emits four events incl. `Cancelled` (retirement/cutover unwind, operator DELETE of not-yet-active windows; `design/07:154`). Tariffs' consume list omits it (T:261). A pre-cached scheduled window that pricing later cancels would never be retracted → Tariffs resolves against a voided window. → add `PriceWindowCancelled` to the consumed set. |
| **W2** | MED | **RESOLVED → Tariffs replays snapshot** | **Open-period re-resolution needs historical windows.** Tariffs re-resolves late-arriving usage for `periodState=open` and mid-period splits (T:663/697), which read window(s) effective at a *past* `t`. Pricing's read-model contract exposes only *active-window-at-`t`* (`PRD:214`); history is in-table SoR (R-12). **Decision (2026-07-10):** Tariffs re-resolves **strictly from the pinned snapshot** (the snapshot pinned at first rating of that window), never a live catalog read — for both posted and open-period late-arrival. No pricing read-model change; pricing only guarantees snapshot retention for the open window. (Rejected: pricing exposing a historical-window query surface — more cost, weaker determinism.) |

## D. Snapshot composition

| # | Sev | Verdict | Seam |
|---|-----|---------|------|
| **S1** | MED | **RESOLVED → canonical list** | **`pricingSnapshotRef` = one ref, three writers; segments not textually reconciled.** Minting authority *is* aligned — pricing names Tariffs the composition SoR (`design/01:214`). **Decision (2026-07-10):** canonical field list, per-segment writer: `catalogVersion` (pricing, pending→committed on `CatalogVersionPublished`) · `resolved price ids` incl. `cohort` (pricing) · `eval-policy version` (pricing) · `(currency, region)` binding (Subscriptions @ activation) · resolved overlay/`priceOverlay` ids (Tariffs @ eval) · applied coupon ids + stacking policy (Tariffs @ eval) · FX-lock id (Tariffs @ eval). Tariffs = composition SoR; both docs record the list identically. "resolved price ids" carry `cohort` (feeds K2). **2026-07-11 (T-D-09):** the canonical list gains the eighth Tariffs-written segment `commitmentReservation` (reservation match; pool set incl. `poolType`, balances @ `balanceVersion`, draw order, rollover; reserved-vs-pool split). |

## E. Pricing models & metering

| # | Sev | Verdict | Seam |
|---|-----|---------|------|
| **M1** | HIGH | T-adopts | **model-kind enum mismatch.** Pricing enum: `{flat, per_unit, graduated, volume, package}` (`PRD:154`). Tariffs §6.2: `{flat, tiered(graduated), volumeA, volumeB, hybrid, committed}`. `hybrid`/`committed` are plan-composition/commercial constructs, not model-kinds (pricing already treats them so). → adopt the pricing §17.2 kind→formula mapping as shared SoR; reclassify hybrid/committed. |
| **M2** | HIGH | **T-adopts (launch-blocking)** | **`per_unit` (per-seat) uncovered.** Pricing p1 launch (`quantitySource ∈ {subscription_seat_count, manual}`, `PRD:363/467`); FixtureGate blocks publish without a joint Tariffs fixture. Tariffs has no per-seat FR (classifies it Follow-on, T:1273). → Tariffs adds a `per_unit` formula FR (unit price × seat count from Subscriptions) + joint fixture, or per-seat plans cannot publish. |
| **M3** | MED | **RESOLVED → T-adopts** | **`package` (block) modelKind — pricing has it, Tariffs has zero (0 hits).** Pricing: `ceil(used/packageSize) × packagePrice`, Tariffs computes the round-up (`PRD:156/509`); p2, own joint fixture required. `package` ≠ Variant B (different math). **Decision (2026-07-10):** Tariffs adds a package-pricing FR (`ceil(used/packageSize) × packagePrice`) — parity with pricing p2 launch. |
| **M4** | MED | T-adopts (delete) | **Volume Variant B (block fee) is an orphan.** Tariffs authors it (T:399); pricing explicitly refuses — "`volume` maps to Variant A only … Variant B dropped and not authorable" (`design/03:99`, D Q3). No catalog authoring home. → delete Variant B from Tariffs §6.2. |
| **M5** | MED | **RESOLVED → T-adopts** | **Composite/derived meter status drift.** Tariffs: Follow-on, "blocked on a derived-meter primitive that must land first" (T:1259). Pricing *delivers* it at launch (Slice 10 formula-as-data over ≥2 units) and hands Tariffs the eval math (`design/10:47`, `PRD:412`). **Decision (2026-07-10):** composite **is in launch**; Tariffs drops the Follow-on marker and adds a composite-formula eval FR consuming the pricing-declared derived meter. |
| **M6** | MED | Joint | **Dimensional pricing status/ownership.** Tariffs §6.7 p1 launch-critical; pricing glossary marks dimensional **Future** yet persists `dimension_key` structurally (`design/03:267`). Both effectively launch empty-tuple (OSS emission gates values). Declaration ownership unassigned. → agree wording: declaration+freeze in-scope now (catalog persists `dimension_key`, Tariffs freezes in snapshot); value-pricing OSS-gated/Future. |
| **M7** | MED | **RESOLVED → superset key** | **Tier-counter `Q` key differs.** Tariffs single-writer key `(meter, dimensionKey, window)` (T:457); pricing `Q` is per `(subscription, meter, window)`, survives supersession (`design/03:193`). **Decision (2026-07-10):** canonical key = `(subscription, meter, dimensionKey, window)` — the superset satisfying both (per-subscription reset scope + per-dimension counters). Recorded identically on both sides; Rating remains single-writer per this key. |
| **M8** | LOW | Naming | **"prepaid" collision.** Tariffs "prepaid pool" = `commitmentPools[]` (Contracts SoR, waterfall). Pricing "prepaid credit grant" = plan-attached wallet (`grantAmount`/`expiryPolicy`), balance owned by Billing/Rating, GA-gated. Different constructs, same word. → name distinctly; note in Tariffs §6.6 the wallet grant is a separate Billing-executed drawdown, not `commitmentPools[]`. |
| **M9** | LOW | T-adopts | **Reserved-rate sourcing split unstated.** Pricing: self-service reserved rate from the catalog snapshot; negotiated RI rates from Contracts (`PRD:935`, `design/10:349`). Tariffs prices "the reserved rate" without the source split. → Tariffs §6.6 states the two-source rule (snapshot vs Contracts overlay/step 5). |
| **M10** | LOW | T-adopts | **`aggregationFunction = sum`-only launch limit stated only by pricing** (`PRD:158`, D Q2; peak/last/unique Future). Tariffs §6.5 silent. → add the sum-only note. **RE-SCOPED 2026-07-16 (product call — pricing D-44 / rating T-D-17)**: the launch product set bills on levels (cloudlet peak-per-hour, storage GB-month) → `aggregationFunction ∈ {sum, peak, time_weighted}` + `aggregationGranularity {hour, day}` in launch; non-`sum` = granule fold over gauge samples, `Q` = Σ granule folds (**additive** — M7/T-D-12/corrections untouched); frozen in the snapshot; joint fixture required; `last`/`unique` stay Future; no composite co-occurrence. Recorded both sides: pricing PRD §1.4/§15(F-40)/§17.8 + design/03 Q2; rating PRD `fr-level-aggregation` + design/03/12/13. |
| **M11** | LOW | T-adopts | **D-17 open-top & D-18 usage-only invariants relied on but unrecorded.** Pricing forbids closed-top bands (`TIER_TOP_CLOSED`, deletes the "fail-closed-above-max" branch, D-17) and restricts graduated/volume/package to `chargeKind=usage` (D-18). Tariffs is consistent (no above-max branch, tier machinery presupposes metered `Q`) but never states the guarantees. → add a one-line "catalog guarantees" note. |

## F. Proration, FX, anchors

| # | Sev | Verdict | Seam |
|---|-----|---------|------|
| **P1** | HIGH | **T-adopts (live CI gate)** | **`prorationBasis` enum missing `none`.** Pricing canonical `{calendar_days_actual, calendar_days_30, by_second, whole_unit, none}`, adopted verbatim by Tariffs, guarded by CI gate `pricing.contracts.enum_drift` (Critical) (`design/06:100/297`). Tariffs lists only 4 (T:114). → add `none` verbatim (pricing rejects `creditOnDowngrade=true` + `none` at publish, so Tariffs never prorates a `none` row, but must recognize the value for the conformance fixture). |
| **P2** | MED | T-adopts | **`billingAnchorPolicy` + D-20 no-drift clamp not referenced.** Pricing owns `billingAnchorPolicy ∈ {calendar_month, subscription_start, fixed_day(d)}` with the 31→28→31 clamp, frozen in the snapshot (`design/06:101`, D-20). Tariffs uses a generic "subscription billing anchor" (T:255). → Tariffs consumes `billingAnchorPolicy` (frozen) as the authority for `invoice_period` boundaries and plan-change split points. |
| **F1** | HIGH | T-adopts | **D-15 phase-invariant usage fallback absent, collides with strict no-gap.** Tariffs: key includes phase + fail on gap (T:141/447). Pricing D-15: usage rows are phase-invariant by default, phase-specific wins — "adopted verbatim by Tariffs" (`DECISIONS:204`). Literal Tariffs raises a spurious eval-fail for a phase covered only by a phase-invariant usage row. → Tariffs encodes phase-fallback for usage rows so the no-gap rule applies to the *resolved* set. |

## G. Bundles, governance, contracts, ASC 606

| # | Sev | Verdict | Seam |
|---|-----|---------|------|
| **G1** | HIGH | **RESOLVED → single engine** | **Double governance.** Both gears claim the two-person publish workflow (Tariffs `fr-publish-approval-governance`, T:766; pricing Slice 5 owns `MaterialityEvaluator` + `ApprovalWorkflow` end-to-end, `design/05:46/215`). Same artifact (price-overlay/overlay publish). **Decision (2026-07-10):** single catalog-publish approval engine = **pricing Slice 5**; Tariffs contributes its four publish-time checks as **registered fail-closed validators** in the pricing pipeline, NOT a second workflow. Contract-level overrides (step 5) stay with Contracts. **Ledger stays separate** — see note below. |
| **B1** | MED | T-adopts | **Bundle summing assigned to Tariffs, but Tariffs is silent on bundles/rev-share.** Pricing: for `sum_of_parts` "the summing is Tariffs'" (`design/08:146`); rev-share normalized to `effective_share_bp` at publish, absorber default platform, "downstream reads only effective shares" (D-07). Tariffs never mentions bundle/rev-share. Clean ownership split (no overlap), but Tariffs must acknowledge the eval-time summing + effective-share pass-through. → add `sum_of_parts` summing + rev-share pass-through to Tariffs scope + §9.2 note. |
| **C1** | MED | T-adopts | **No Catalog/Pricing read-model consumer contract in Tariffs §9.2.** Tariffs §9.2 lists only Rating/Finance/Promotions/Billing (T:818). Pricing `design/06` is a full frozen consumer contract Tariffs must adopt (prorationBasis verbatim, rating-compat `{skuId,planId,priceId}`, grant set, plan-change contract). → add a §9.2 "Catalog/Pricing read-model input contract" + a Subscriptions `(changeEffectiveAt, changeMode)` input contract. |
| **ASC** | LOW | P-extends (deferred) | **SSP/PO source gap.** Tariffs requires `performanceObligationRef` + `sspSnapshotPointer` (nullable, T:754). Pricing supplies `glCode` now but defers SSP to Future (`PRD:2331`). Fields resolve **null at MVP** — no contradiction. → acknowledge null@MVP on both sides; `glCode` flows now. |

## H. Naming

| # | Sev | Verdict | Seam |
|---|-----|---------|------|
| **N1** | LOW | Naming | **Gear-name drift.** Tariffs says "Catalog / Price Book" / "Product Catalog"; pricing gear is "Pricing / Product Catalog" and names the consumer `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-actor-rating`. → pin one canonical name for the pricing/catalog gear across both PRDs. |

---

## I. Registry (Product & SKU) — prospective seams (2026-07-11, PR #4177)

> The **Product & SKU Management** PRD carves the catalog **registry** out of manifest §4.1:
> Product / SKU / Category / Attribute, lifecycle, approvals, and the registry-wide
> `CatalogVersion`. The rating gear becomes a **second-order consumer** (registry → plan-price →
> rating); the resource half of "resource @ price" is the SKU's **metering-unit declaration**.
> **2026-07-16 — vendored**: the PRD now lives on this branch at
> `gears/bss/products/docs/PRD.md` (from `constructorfabric/gears-rust` PR #4177 @ `6d3aab4`;
> upstream-detach decision — this branch is canonical, no PR engagement owed). The RG2 fix is
> **applied in the vendored copy**; RG1 stays open; RG3 is recorded as localization debt in the
> vendored PRD's provenance note.

| # | Sev | Verdict | Seam |
|---|-----|---------|------|
| **RG1** | HIGH | Joint | **Freeze protocols must compose.** The registry gates posted/contractual resolution on `freezeComplete` (participants: plan-price, Contracts, Billing — **rating absent**); pricing gates the rating pin on `CatalogVersionPublished` + warm-completion (pin lag ≤ 5s); rating replays posted periods strictly from pinned snapshots (W2). One composed contract is needed: is pricing's warm marker the rating-facing freeze ack, or must rating join the participant set? A registry-side reject-until-freeze must not stall the rating pin path. |
| **RG2** | HIGH | Joint | **Single-unit-per-SKU vs dimensional & composite pricing.** Registry: a usage SKU declares **exactly one** metering unit; multi-dimension usage = **separate SKUs** composed at plan/bundle level. Rating/pricing: dimensional pricing is one meter + `dimensionKey` tuple **lines** (rating PRD §6.7), and composite meters are formula-as-data over **≥ 2 input units** (pricing design/10). Where composite input units and declared dimension sets live in the registry model must be pinned jointly — "separate SKUs" and "dimension tuples on one meter" are different shapes. **Proposed pin (2026-07-16, BSS side, for PR #4177 FR `…fr-metering-unit-declaration`):** the root defect is a **unit ≠ dimension conflation** ("exactly one unit *(single-dimension)*"). (1) Keep the invariant verbatim: one usage SKU = one metering unit (counted identity, immutable). (2) Drop "(single-dimension)" and the separate-SKUs mandate: the **declared dimension set** over a meter is a **plan-price concern** — the registry itself delegates "plan-level meter binding is plan-price" (PR PRD:126), pricing already persists `dimension_key` on the plan-price revision (rating PRD §6.7), rating freezes it in the snapshot; no new registry field needed. (3) Separate SKUs demoted rule→option (legitimate only where variants differ commercially: accounting codes/lifecycle); per-combination minting is the rating-PRD §17.3 "exploding cardinality" workaround and must not be the permanent shape (S3 = 6×30×5 = 900 SKUs vs 1 SKU + 3 keys). (4) Composite: the SKU declares the composite's **output** unit as its one unit; input units are referenced by the plan-price formula against the recognized-unit set and **need no SKUs**; "composed at plan/bundle level" must not conflate bundle composition with meter formulas. **APPLIED 2026-07-16** in the vendored copy (`gears/bss/products/docs/PRD.md`, `fr-metering-unit-declaration` reworded; provenance note records the local change) — RG2 **closed**. |
| **RG3** | MED | Naming | **Pre-consolidation naming.** The draft references `PRD-tariffs-pricing-logic` and `PRD-rating-engine` as separate modules and mints `cpt-cf-bss-products-actor-tariffs`. Post ADR-0002 there is one **rating** gear (evaluation core + pipeline; the rating-engine PRD is absorbed), and pricing's consumer actor is already merged into the rating actor. **RECONCILED 2026-07-16** in the vendored copy (first substantive edit, per its provenance note): `…-actor-tariffs` merged into `…-actor-rating`; §2.1 delegations + §17 reference table localized to `gears/bss/rating/docs/PRD.md`; `refs:` front-matter kept verbatim as provenance — RG3 **closed**. |

Aligned (no action needed): unit-identity **immutability** + deprecate-then-remove (GB ≠ GiB — a
correction is a new unit) matches the frozen-snapshot / pinned-replay doctrine (W2, T-D-04); the
`{skuId, planId, priceId}` rating triple keys off the registry's immutable `skuId`; the
grandfathering invariant (snapshots never mutated) matches posted-period protection.

| # | Sev | Verdict | Seam |
|---|-----|---------|------|
| **UC1** | CRIT | **UC-extends (metering phase 2)** | **Transport model: designed-for stream vs built pull.** Slice 12's `IntakeConsumer` presumes a durable, at-least-once, per-partition-ordered transport with offsets + source replay (design/12 §3.3/§3.8/§4.3). Collector v1 has **no emission surface**: event architecture "Not applicable in v1"; near-real-time consumers poll a Query SPI that is eventually consistent **with no upper bound**, read-after-write only via the ingestion ack (UC-DESIGN:1171, §3.10). A poll bridge is not a substitute: the raw query has **no accepted-order cursor** (event-time filters miss late-accepted records behind the cursor), no freshness bound, per-plugin consistency ceilings, and deactivations are invisible to it (UC5) — a naive poller silently misses records and retractions → wrong charges. → collector grows a **transactional-outbox emission surface** (`UsageRecordAccepted` — covers usage *and* compensation entries — and `UsageRecordDeactivated` incl. the depth-1 cascade list), ordered per `tenant_id` partition, at-least-once, idempotency-tuple-keyed. The hook is already reserved as **additive within REST v1 / SDK v1** (ADR-0006, UC-DESIGN:1171), and the collector's deferred-items table names exactly this trigger ("re-evaluate when downstream consumers require coordinated historical re-emission"). |
| **UC2** | HIGH | Joint | **Completeness / watermark signal for period close.** Rating stays *correct* without one — open-period late arrival re-resolves from the pinned snapshot, posted-period is delta-only (design/08) — but with no per-`(tenant, UsageType)` ingestion watermark every period close is maximally provisional and the correction-cascade / `Adjustment` volume grows with lateness. Collector v1 explicitly defers watermark/reconciliation metadata (UC-PRD:189; UC-DESIGN:1162). → phase 2 adds an accepted high-watermark per `(tenant, UsageType)` (API + periodic watermark event); rating consumes it as a **soft** close gate (grace window before the period tick finalizes usage lines) — never a correctness dependency. |
| **UC3** | HIGH | Joint | **Attribution join: `(tenant, UsageType, resource_ref, subject_ref)` → `(subscription, meter, dimensionKey)`.** The collector deliberately knows none of the right-hand side. Slice 12's `Normalizer` presumes a frozen subscription/meter linkage (design/12 §4.1). Three pins needed: **(a) meter binding** — the catalog-declared meter carries a `usageTypeRef` (collector `gts_id`) as the authoritative binding, validated at publish (registry/pricing side; adjacent to RG2's metering-unit declaration); **(b) subscription resolution** — `resource_ref` → subscription via the Subscriptions entitlement/resource linkage (S1/SUB-R1 frozen context); an ambiguous or unresolvable `resource_ref` quarantines, never guesses (design/12 §4.5); **(c) dimension carrier** — `dimensionKey` values ride the UsageType's declared closed-shape, string-only `metadata_fields`; the meter's declared dimension set must equal the declared metadata keys (publish-time cross-validation — the G1 registered-validator pattern). (c) closes the §17.3 emission-shape half of **M6**. |
| **UC4** | MED | Joint | **Dedup-key derivation across the boundary.** Slice-12 `usageKey = (sourceSystem, meterId, sourceEventId)` (design/12 §4.3); collector identity is `(tenant_id, gts_id, idempotency_key)` — unique per tenant **per UsageType**, unbounded window, exact-equality retry absorbed / divergent reuse rejected as conflict (UC-PRD fr-idempotency). Map: `sourceSystem = usage-collector`; `meterId` ← the UC3(a) binding; `sourceEventId` ← the full `(tenant_id, gts_id, idempotency_key)` tuple — the *contractual* identity (plugin record ids are backend-scoped). Key reuse across UsageTypes is legitimate collector-side, so `sourceEventId` MUST embed the `gts_id` scope. Both dedup windows unbounded — aligned. |
| **UC5** | MED | Joint | **Corrections mapping + visibility.** Semantics map cleanly: a collector **compensation** (counter-only, strictly-negative, references the original active entry) → a correcting `UsageRecord` with `corrects` lineage (design/12 §4.4); an **event deactivation** (whole-row one-way `active→inactive`, depth-1 cascade flipping its active compensations) → a full-reversal correction of the record's prior contribution to `Q`. But rating must *observe* both: compensation rides the collector's ingestion path (UC1's `UsageRecordAccepted` covers it); **deactivation is an operator REST write with no ingestion event** — the UC1 surface MUST emit `UsageRecordDeactivated` (with the cascaded compensation flips), else retractions are silently missed. Rating side unchanged: the mapped correction re-materializes `Q` (design/13 §4.4) and re-resolves under `periodState` rules (design/08 §4.3). |
| **UC6** | MED | Joint | **Temporal shape: point-stamped values vs intervals.** The collector v1 record is `(value, created_at)` under `counter`/`gauge` kinds — **no interval kind**; rating design/12 §3.1 expects "quantity **or start/stop interval**" (the `SessionMerger` overlap-union machinery presupposes `[start, stop)` geometry). Bridge today: duration consumption is emitted as **chunked counter deltas** (chunk cadence ≤ the finest attribution boundary — splits land on day granularity, practical guidance: hourly), which reduces slice-12 session merge to summation; `gauge` **is rateable since D-44/T-D-17** (M10 re-scoped 2026-07-16): level meters declare `aggregationFunction ∈ {peak, time_weighted}` and rating folds samples per granule — sources emit raw levels, never pre-folded values. The event never carries a billing period — windowing is rating's (`WindowResolver` from event time under the frozen anchor), and sources MUST NOT round (`billingGranularity` round-up is the core's, after merge). → a native **interval/duration kind** is a phase-2+ collector increment candidate (additive; the feed entry shape of `fr-usage-event-feed` carries it untouched); until then the chunked-delta contract + granularity rule is the pinned bridge. |

Aligned (no action needed): mandatory client idempotency keys + **unbounded** dedup window +
fail-closed ingestion + immutable rows + append-only corrections + "no business logic in the
collector" all match slice 12's mediation doctrine (normalize-once/freeze-forever, authoritative
dedup, quarantine-never-guess); NFR envelopes compose (collector sustains ≥ 10k rec/s ≈ 864M/day
platform-wide vs rating's ≥ 10M ev/day/region intake).

## Governance topology note (G1 — why ledger is not the merge target)

Three maker-checker engines exist in adjacent bounded contexts; they share the *pattern*, not
the *policy*:
- **Ledger** — `dual_control_policy` + **Finance Approver**; governs financial **postings** (JE,
  refund > threshold, backdating, period reopen, suspense clearing, GL write-off). Materiality =
  amount/entity thresholds + backdating days. Subject = posted journal entries.
- **Pricing Slice 5** — `MaterialityEvaluator` + `ApprovalWorkflow` + a **separate** `approval_policy`
  resource; **FinanceReviewer** approver; governs catalog **publish** (price/plan deltas +
  always-material triggers). Pricing already cites the ledger `dual_control_policy` as **precedent**
  (`design/05:262`) and deliberately keeps its own policy resource.
- **Tariffs** — folds into pricing Slice 5 (same subject: catalog publish).

Merging catalog-publish governance into the ledger is a category error — different subject
(commercial config vs financial posting), approver role, and materiality; a price change becomes a
posting only later via Rating→Billing→Ledger. No shared platform governance library exists today
(`gears/bss/libs/` holds only `coord`). **Optional post-launch:** extract a shared maker-checker/audit
mechanism into `libs/` (à la `libs/coord`) that pricing + tariffs + ledger instantiate, each with its
own policy — DRY the mechanism, not the policy. Not a launch blocker.

## Decisions register (to close before Design lock)

**Resolved this session (2026-07-10):**
- **M3** — `package` pricing: **Tariffs adds a package FR** (parity with pricing p2 launch).
- **M5** — composite/derived meter: **in launch**; Tariffs adds a composite-formula eval FR.
- **G1** — governance: **single pricing Slice 5 engine**; Tariffs registers validators; ledger separate.
- **O3** — step-4 overlay composition: **stack all survivors**; class order = tie-break, not exclusivity.
- **W2** — open-period re-resolution: **Tariffs replays the pinned snapshot** (no pricing read-model change).
- **S1** — canonical `pricingSnapshotRef` field list fixed, per-segment writer ownership (Tariffs = composition SoR).
- **M7** — canonical tier-counter `Q` key = `(subscription, meter, dimensionKey, window)`.

**Resolved 2026-07-11 (Design pass, tri-review closures — T-D-09…T-D-15 in [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md)):**
- **S1 residue** — eighth `commitmentReservation` snapshot segment (T-D-09).
- **Balance write-back / sequencing** — Rating publishes `CommitmentBalanceEffect`s; Contracts serializes per-pool `balanceVersion`; balance-affecting corrections cascade delta-only re-resolution of later units (T-D-10; cross-PRD obligation on Contracts/Rating).
- **Delta-dedup owner** — Rating (T-D-11).
- **Windowed-model continuity across intra-window boundaries** — per-slice sub-window units + frozen `bandOffsetQ`, adopting pricing `inst-tb-window-continuity`; correction key gains the slice coordinate (T-D-12).
- **Step-6 recompute** — steps 3–5 re-run as a unit over the reservation remainder; tier-counter exclusion + pool asymmetry registered in Tariffs PRD §6.6 / AC 19 (T-D-13).
- **Commitment pool flavors + true-up formulas** — frozen `poolType ∈ {prepaid_drawdown, committed_rate}`; sale bills outside PLAL (T-D-14).
- **Period-driven units** — Rating's period tick synthesizes recurring/capacity/true-up units at `AnchorPeriod` boundaries (T-D-15).

**Product / commercial calls (owner sign-off) — still open:**
- **M6** — dimensional pricing launch posture (empty-tuple at launch either way; wording + declaration ownership). Proposed: declaration+freeze in-scope now, value-pricing OSS-gated.

**Technical residues — still open (from the 2026-07-11 slice review):**
- **S1 segment naming** — **RESOLVED 2026-07-11 (T-D-09)**: the step-6 frozen identifiers form the eighth named segment `commitmentReservation` (writer: Tariffs @ eval; no pricing-side change), recorded identically in tariffs `design/01` §4.3, `design/05` §4.1, and `design/11` §4.7.
- **Composite × dimensions input-join rule** — pin with pricing before dimensional values and composite meters co-occur (tariffs `design/03` §3.6).
- **Mixed-settlement coupon rules** — `exclusive_best` cross-currency benefit comparison and mixed-settlement `ordered_stack` folding: both fail-closed until pinned with Promotions (tariffs `design/06` §4.2).
- **Seat-change boundary transport** — Subscriptions-driven change boundary vs Subscriptions-side proration for mid-period `subscription_seat_count` changes (tariffs `design/09` §4.3; default: change-boundary).
- **Bundle-level coupon attachment** — bundle-total coupon scope vs component-line attachment (tariffs `design/10` §4.5; until pinned: component lines only).
- **Usage-Collector ingestion bridge (2026-07-16)** — UC1–UC6 (§J): emission surface / transport (UC1, gates pipeline slice-12 implementation), completeness watermark (UC2), attribution join incl. dimension carrier (UC3, closes the M6 emission-shape half), dedup-key derivation (UC4), correction visibility (UC5), temporal shape / interval kind (UC6: chunked-delta bridge now, native interval kind phase-2+; gauge not rateable at launch) — pinned jointly with the usage-collector gear; proposal drafted 2026-07-16: **`gears/system/usage-collector/docs/PRD-phase2-usage-event-feed.md`** (Usage Event Feed + ingestion watermarks; executes the collector's reserved DESIGN §4 hooks, additive under its ADR-0006; closes UC1/UC2/UC5 and the UC4 key-derivation rule on adoption; UC3 attribution join stays with registry/pricing).

**Propagation status:** all Tariffs-adopts items below + the resolved decisions (M1–M5, O1–O3, K1–K5, P1–P2, W1, F1, S1, M7, M9–M11, B1, C1, N1, M6) are **propagated into `PRD.md`** (2026-07-10, 5 assert-anchored batches; `cfs validate` + `validate-toc` green). A 4-agent fresh-eye consistency pass then closed the propagation residues (stale ACs 2/6/14, §2.2 key, §6.3 scope-mapping, governance FR/NFR/AC self-workflow, §17.3/17.4 composite-Follow-on, model-coverage lists, gear name) and added joint-fixture ACs 5a/5b/5c for per_unit / package / composite. Design lock still needs pricing-side confirmation of O3 (tie-break-not-exclusivity) and the M6 wording. **Pre-existing upstream note (not our residue):** §5.1 AC cross-references (AC 21/22/23 etc.) don't match §12 numbering (max AC 20) — a vendored-PRD numbering drift to reconcile during Design.

**Tariffs-adopts (mechanical conformance — no product/pricing decision):**
- K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, O1, O2, W1, M1, M2 (launch-blocking), M4 (delete), M9, M10, M11, P1 (live CI gate), P2, F1, B1, C1, N1
