//! `CatalogVersion` and the pin-eligibility frontier.
//!
//! A consumer resolves the published read model at exactly one **pin-eligible**
//! `CatalogVersion` for the duration of a resolution or rating run. Whether a
//! version is pin-eligible is a version-level, prefix-closed predicate
//! (`design/01-foundation.md` §4.4, D-101 + D-114): the version is committed,
//! every subject row it projects is warm-complete, and every earlier version is
//! itself pin-eligible. No consumer can evaluate that for itself, so the gear
//! materializes the frontier and publishes it (D-136) — this type is what it
//! serves.
//!
//! **What a pin buys today, stated because the predicate above does not say
//! it.** The frontier is real: a version reaches it only once every subject the
//! gear knows it published is warm. What a consumer cannot yet do is *resolve*
//! anything at that pin **through this SDK** — `PricingCatalogClientV1` has no
//! implementor, which is what D-347 records as owed.
//!
//! Two surfaces do resolve at the pin frontier: `GET /plans/{planId}/preview`
//! and `GET /plans/{planId}/sellability` read the frontier and then the delta at
//! that version, and both are mounted, authorized and route-tested. Saying the
//! gear has no resolution surface at all is what sends a reader chasing a route
//! that exists. What no surface does is resolve the **full published payload**
//! the PRD asks for, and the delta a version freezes deliberately omits the facts
//! whose slices are unbuilt (the `PriceWindow` intervals and the derived
//! coverage end, the GA-gate flags, the registry `sellable` flag, and the grant
//! set). So a version is pinnable and its payload is incomplete, and a reader is
//! entitled to know which of the six sellability predicates it can evaluate from
//! one: not (1), not (5), not (6).
//!
//! The Slice-6 cross-boundary contract is **not** among those omissions: D-169
//! struck `crossBoundaryWarningText` from the contract — the copy belongs to the
//! surface that renders it, PRD AC #66 — so the marker waits on nothing, and
//! every resolved plan subject carries it.
