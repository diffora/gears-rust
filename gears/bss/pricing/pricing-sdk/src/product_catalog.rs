//! The Product & SKU registry's **read** contract, as this gear needs it.
//!
//! # What the catalog actually needs from the registry, and nothing more
//!
//! A price row is keyed on a **meter** and a plan may be **bound to a SKU**, and
//! both of those are strings and ids this gear takes as given: it owns no
//! registry, validates neither against one, and is not made correct by having
//! this port. What the port buys is the one thing missing without it — an
//! operator authoring a row or binding a plan has **no way to know what the
//! catalog sells**, so the pick-lists can only ever offer what the tenant has
//! already used, and a first row for a new SKU is typed from memory.
//!
//! SKU browsing is a suggestion source. `list_tax_categories` also exposes the
//! registry-owned category dictionary: pricing owns the assignment on a price
//! row, not a category default on a SKU or region. The dictionary defines codes
//! and labels, not rates or tax calculation rules.
//! No create, no lifecycle, no resolution — those belong to the registry's own
//! authoring surface (`cpt-cf-bss-products-interface-authoring-publish`), and a
//! gear that could write the catalog it prices would be the second author of it.
//!
//! # Why it lives in the SDK
//!
//! [`CatalogVersionRegistryV1`](crate::catalog_version_registry)'s reason,
//! unchanged: the contract belongs where the registry gear can implement it
//! without depending on `bss-pricing`. The two ports are the same relationship
//! seen from two sides — that one asks the registry to increment, this one asks
//! it what it holds.
//!
//! # Failing is not the same as answering "none"
//!
//! SKU validity does not depend on the browse list, so the fail-closed posture the version registry
//! takes would be wrong here: a publish must not proceed on an invented version,
//! but a pick-list with no suggestions is merely a pick-list with no
//! suggestions. What must **not** happen is the two being confused. An empty
//! catalog and an unreachable registry are opposite facts for an operator about
//! to type a SKU id from memory, and the surface over this port is required to
//! tell them apart — which is why the error is a typed absence rather than an
//! empty `Vec`.
//!
//! # Canonical at the boundary, typed projection beside it
//!
//! Per ADR `cpt-cf-errors-adr-sdk-canonical-projection` the trait returns
//! [`CanonicalError`]; [`ProductCatalogError`] is an **opt-in** view over it, not
//! the contract. Adding a variant to the projection is not an SDK break, and the
//! catch-all [`ProductCatalogError::Other`] keeps the conversion infallible so a
//! category this port does not emit today still arrives with full fidelity.
//!
//! The three dispositions and how they are carried:
//!
//! | disposition | canonical | projection |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | no registry wired | `Unimplemented` | [`ProductCatalogError::Unconfigured`] |
//! | configured, did not answer | `ServiceUnavailable` | [`ProductCatalogError::Unreachable`] |
//! | answered unusably | `Internal` | [`ProductCatalogError::Internal`] |
//!
//! `Unimplemented` carries "no registry wired" because it is the one category
//! that says *this deployment does not offer the capability* — which is the fact,
//! and which no reason string is needed to tell apart from an outage.
