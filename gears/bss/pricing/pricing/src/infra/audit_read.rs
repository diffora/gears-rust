//! The Auditor read over `pricing_audit_log` — `design/05-governance.md` §5's
//! `GET /bss-pricing/v1/audit`, `inst-au-read`, D-12, D-125.
//!
//! `infra/history.rs`'s twin one plane over, and deliberately its twin: a
//! commit-ordered keyset walk over an append-only store, a page request that
//! restates D-125's three branches over the two numbers D-125 owns, and an opaque
//! token that spells the walk's whole position. What differs is the store, the
//! audience and the position's width — and each difference is stated where it
//! lands rather than left for a reader to infer from a shared shape.
//!
//! # Why this exists at all, and what depended on it
//!
//! The table had **one** entry point — [`audit_repo::append`] — and no reader on
//! any mounted surface, while `infra/error_mapping.rs` justifies dropping the
//! detail from three 403 arms on the ground that *"the attempt itself is already
//! on `pricing_audit_log` as a `deny` record carrying that id … a durable trail
//! rather than a log line"*. The trail was durable and unreachable, so the
//! compensating control the error ladder names did not exist. This is that
//! control. The route is the one the design set names; nothing here invents a
//! surface.
//!
//! # Auditor-only, and the actor is the record's own column
//!
//! `audit × read` gates it (D-12), which is the same pair `/history` asks for and
//! **not** the same disclosure: that surface answers `pricing_price` rows with the
//! authoring principal off their own `created_by`, while this one answers the
//! before/after states and the approval trail. The permission is shared because
//! D-12 confines both to the Auditor; the content is not.
//!
//! Every principal id here is pseudonymous by the column's own type
//! (`inst-au-pii`), so a page carries no directly identifying operator PII and this
//! surface needs no redaction step. That is a property of the writer, asserted
//! there, and it is the reason a 7-year store can be read at all.
//!
//! # What is **not** here
//!
//! **Filters.** `inst-au-read` says "under Auditor-only filters" and enumerates
//! none, while the two discriminators a filter would name — `subject_kind` and
//! `action` — are declared vocabularies (D-158). A filter set chosen here would be
//! a wire contract this gear invented, so the page is unfiltered and the filters
//! are owed. A caller narrows by walking, which the cursor makes bounded.
//!
//! **The export.** `audit × export` is a second permission for a second shape —
//! chunks under their own p95, not pages — and nothing gates on it. Owed, and not
//! approximated by a large `limit`.
