//! A **static, invented** product catalog, for deployments with no registry gear
//! to ask.
//!
//! # This is fabricated catalog content, on purpose
//!
//! [`ProductCatalogClientV1`](crate::domain::ports::ProductCatalogClientV1) is
//! the registry's read contract, and the registry is not in this repository:
//! `gears/bss/products` holds a PRD and no code. Without *some* source the SKU
//! pick-lists can only offer what the tenant has already priced, so the first
//! row for a new SKU is typed from memory and the plan's `sku_id` is typed as a
//! bare UUID — which is the state the stand was in.
//!
//! So the trade is stated rather than hidden, and it is a **worse trade than
//! [`local_dev_registry`](crate::infra::local_dev_registry)'s** in one specific
//! way worth being plain about. An invented `CatalogVersion` is a number that
//! collides with a real registry's numbering; an invented SKU is *content an
//! operator cannot tell from the real catalog*, and a row priced against one
//! carries its unit into a real scope key that outlives the demo.
//!
//! Four properties keep that visible rather than invisible:
//!
//! * **It is opt-in by a value that says what it is.** The config takes
//!   `mode = "local_dev_static_skus"`, which cannot be set by accident.
//! * **Every id is from one reserved namespace.** Each `sku_id` begins
//!   [`DEV_LOCAL_SKU_PREFIX`], so a plan bound to a fabricated SKU is found later
//!   with `WHERE sku_id::text LIKE 'ddddddd%'` — the same sweepability the
//!   invented version refs have.
//! * **Every code is prefixed `DEV-`.** The operator reading the pick-list sees
//!   it in the list, not only in a config file they will never open.
//! * **It says so on every boot**, at `warn!`, naming the mode.
//!
//! # Why these SKUs
//!
//! They are the Pricing Studio prototype's own set, trimmed: the same codes,
//! names and declared units, because the point of the mode is to make the stand
//! demonstrate the flows the prototype demonstrates. A unit here is a real
//! metering unit the pricing rules will accept — `vCPU-hour`, `GiB-month` — so a
//! row authored from this list is a well-formed row. Only its provenance is
//! fictional.
