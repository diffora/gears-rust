//! `WindowService` — the three window mutations, each as one publish unit (D-99).
//!
//! `POST /prices/{priceId}/windows`, `PATCH` and `DELETE
//! /price-windows/{windowId}` are the surfaces; this is what they call. Each is
//! one transaction in `PublishService::commit`'s own sequence: re-validate,
//! request the version (D-156 — after re-validation, before the writes), write
//! the row change, record the pending ref that carries the plan subject, enqueue
//! the event, write the audit record. **No interim state**: a mutation that
//! cannot get a version leaves the store exactly as it found it.
//!
//! # Why a window mutation is a publish and not a store write
//!
//! `inst-ws-publishunit` (D-99): the read model carries window **intervals**, and
//! predicate (1) of the sellability gate plus the D-80 coverage horizon are
//! required to be evaluable from the **pinned** model (`inst-sg-pinned`). A
//! cancellation that only moved the truth side would leave the last-warmed delta
//! advertising coverage the store had removed — selling into exactly the trailing
//! void D-62 → D-80 → D-94 closed. So the mutation re-projects the plan subject
//! and is consumer-visible only at `CatalogVersionPublished` + warm, which is why
//! all three surfaces answer **202** and not 200.
//!
//! The unit is [`PlanPublishUnit::window_mutation`] — G1's discriminator, not a
//! second unit type, and the `revision` it names is the plan's **current** one: a
//! window mutation authors no plan content and opens no revision.
//!
//! # What is re-validated here, and what deliberately is not
//!
//! `inst-fg-when` says the coverage check runs at publish **and** inside every
//! window-mutating operation. It says that in §3's *Future-Gap Detection*
//! section, about that section's two rules — `inst-fg-detect`'s interior gap and
//! `inst-fg-trailing`'s trailing void. It does **not** reach §3's
//! *Publish-Time* Window Coverage subsection, and the difference is not a
//! technicality:
//!
//! * `inst-wc-required` refuses a billable row whose key holds no live window.
//!   Run here it would refuse the very mutation that fixes it — an operator
//!   scheduling the first window of an uncovered key would be told the key is
//!   uncovered. A rule whose enforcement blocks its own remedy is a deadlock,
//!   and publish is where that rule belongs because publish is the freezing act.
//! * `inst-wc-availability` judges the **plan's** purchasability dates against
//!   per-key coverage; it is a finding about the plan, and the publish report is
//!   its surface (`api::rest::windows` says the same thing about the coverage
//!   GET).
//!
//! And the two rules that *do* run here are scoped to **the key being mutated**.
//! A mutation can only move that key's interval set, so a pre-existing gap on a
//! sibling key is a fault this call neither caused nor can fix; refusing on it
//! would make every key of a plan hostage to the worst one.
//!
//! # The row set is the validation set, not the projected set
//!
//! This path is on the **validation** side of the crate's one deliberate
//! asymmetry, and it inherits that side rather than choosing it. The plan's rows
//! reach it through `publish::assemble_from`, which loads `CANDIDATE_ROW_STATES` —
//! `published` plus the `draft` rows a publish would produce; the window plane
//! reaches it through `window_repo::list_for_plan`, which is every state over every
//! row; and the overlap check inside `window_repo` runs over
//! `price_repo::load_scope_keys_for_plan`, which is draft-inclusive for its own
//! stated reason. All three are the readers that ask "*if* this were current, would
//! the interval set be sound?".
//!
//! The two readers that assert fact **to a consumer** — `read_model::project_windows`
//! and the activation sweep — restrict to `PROJECTED_ROW_STATES` instead. That
//! asymmetry is the point and not an inconsistency to tidy: a mutation refused for a
//! draft row's key is refused conservatively, while a *projection* that included one
//! would advertise coverage nothing published.
//!
//! # The plan shape comes from the **current** revision, and it has to
//!
//! `infra::publish::assemble` resolves the plan's **open draft** and answers
//! `NotFound` when there is none. A window mutation's ordinary subject is a
//! *published* plan with no draft at all, so assembling that way would make the
//! whole surface answer 404 for exactly the case it exists to serve. This path
//! resolves `plan_repo::load_current` and calls `publish::assemble_from` with it,
//! which is not a convenience but G1's decision:
//! [`PlanPublishUnit::window_mutation`]'s own doc fixes the unit's revision as the
//! plan's current one, "and not an open draft's".
//!
//! Two facts come off that single read and both matter. The revision **number**
//! is what the pending ref pins, so the projector freezes the revision this call
//! validated rather than whichever is current when the sweep arrives (D-165). The
//! revision's **`lifecycle_state`** is what the ref carries as the subject state,
//! and taking it off the same record is what keeps this path from asking twice
//! which revision is current and getting two answers.
//!
//! A plan that has **never published** therefore has no window surface at all —
//! `NotFound`, because there is no current revision to project and a window on an
//! unpublished plan's draft row has nothing to be consumer-visible *in*.
//!
//! # And that refusal is a **rule** (D-314), not this function's choice of reader
//!
//! Argued from `load_current`'s state list alone — which is all the paragraph above
//! does — the 404 reads like an accident of reusing one repository function, and an
//! accident is something a later author deletes. It is not one, and the two grounds
//! were measured by lifting the restriction rather than reasoned about.
//!
//! **The store has no `draft` to pin.** Step 6 records
//! `(subject_revision, subject_lifecycle_state)`, and
//! `chk_pricing_catalog_version_ref_subject_lifecycle` admits
//! `NULL | 'published' | 'retired'` — read off the constraint as it now stands after
//! `pricing_catalog_version_ref`'s rebuild, not off the migration that first wrote it. Relaxing
//! the domain check for the **schedule** verb alone takes three edits, one per
//! `load_current` in the path (`read_plan_context` below,
//! `approval::current_revision_shape`, `approval::submit_window_mutation_on`), and the
//! act then runs the whole way — coverage passes, the evaluator answers
//! `Material { reason: FirstPublish }`, a second principal approves, the registry
//! answers a handle — before aborting at the write with a `CHECK` failure surfaced as
//! `DomainError::Internal`. A partial relaxation converts a truthful 404 into a 500.
//!
//! **And the projector's licence does not extend to a draft.** `read_model` pins the
//! revision *number* and the lifecycle *state* on the ref row and deliberately pins no
//! content, on the stated premise that "a published revision row and its
//! revision-scoped children are physically immutable". A draft's are not:
//! `plan_shape_repo::set_descriptor_set` rewrites a draft revision's descriptor set
//! after the ref naming it exists, and `plan_repo::load_revision` — the projector's
//! content read — carries no state filter and hands the draft back. The sweep arrives
//! up to D-47's five-minute batching maximum later and writes an INSERT-only row on the
//! seven-year horizon, so a draft-pinned delta would freeze whatever the draft said at
//! sweep time: content no rule judged and that keeps moving afterwards.
//!
//! # A billable row cannot ride a plan's **first** publish — it takes two, and
//! both are reachable
//!
//! The two sections above state a fact and why it is a rule; this states the
//! consequence it has, and the consequence is narrower than it looks. Put together:
//!
//! * `plan_repo::load_current` resolves `published | retired`
//!   ([`LifecycleState::is_current_revision`](crate::domain::lifecycle::LifecycleState::is_current_revision)),
//!   so all three window mutations answer **404 `current plan revision not found`**
//!   on a plan whose only revision is a `draft`. Measured over HTTP, not inferred.
//! * `inst-wc-required` refuses a publish whose billable key holds **no** live
//!   window, and that rule is at publish for the reason the section above gives.
//!
//! So a billable row's key needs a window before the publish that freezes the row,
//! and the window needs a revision the publish has already frozen. **The order is
//! therefore forced: an empty first publish, then the row and its window, then the
//! publish that freezes them.** Nothing is unreachable.
//!
//! **A plan's first publish is reachable through the mounted surfaces**, and what
//! makes it so is that `coverage::check` ranges over the **billable** set: a plan
//! with no price row presents no key to find uncovered, and `run_publish_rules`
//! carries no minimum-row rule. A draft plan whose *shape* is sound publishes with an
//! empty row set, which leaves a current revision for a window mutation to freeze.
//! `rest_windows.rs::a_plans_first_window_is_authorable_through_the_routes_after_an_empty_publish`
//! executes the whole sequence through the mounted surfaces — submit, an independent
//! approve, the commit, `POST …/plans/{planId}/prices`, the threshold-policy `PUT` and
//! *its* independent approve, `POST …/prices/{priceId}/windows` — and ends on a
//! **mutating** 202.
//!
//! The policy step joined that list when the schedule began consulting the evaluator,
//! and it is not a detour: an unconfigured tenant has every act material, so a schedule
//! would answer with a unit rather than a window. It is the same two-person shape as the
//! first publish, so what is left is still an ordering constraint and not a deadlock.
//!
//! **What the sequence costs (D-314).** The ordering needs no design decision; what
//! it leaves behind does. The empty publish is a real publish:
//! it commits a version and freezes a delta carrying `lifecycleState: "published"`,
//! `prices: []` and `windows: []`, INSERT-only on the seven-year horizon. Of
//! `inst-sg-pinned`'s six predicates the three a version can answer today — committed
//! addressability, the purchasability dates and the plan lifecycle state — all answer
//! affirmatively, and the rest have no key to be evaluated on, because
//! `inst-sg-conjunction` ranges over the plan's keys on a bound `(currency, region)`
//! and this revision publishes none. Whether a storefront can bind a market on a plan
//! that publishes no key is Subscriptions' half of the joint gate; what is recorded is
//! the artifact, not a verdict about it, and D-314 states why closing it is a change to
//! the sellability gate rather than a change here. A plan that *already* carries rows
//! pays the same order the hard way — the rows come out, the plan publishes empty, the
//! rows go back — because no other surface authors a window either (`infra::import` has
//! none by its own design). The in-crate fixtures schedule their coverage window
//! through `window_repo` directly, for isolation and speed.
//!
//! # The two-person control runs here, on **all four** acts, and two of them for a
//! # different reason than the other two
//!
//! `inst-mat-registered` puts *"window cancellation and `effectiveTo` shortening"* on
//! the **always-material** trigger list, and D-62's Problem paragraph is the act it
//! exists to stop: one `plan × write` holder cancels the two-person-approved
//! scheduled successor, the active window expires at its natural end, and every
//! arrears charge on the key fails closed. So the `DELETE` and a **shortening**
//! `PATCH` do not commit on one principal. Each one:
//!
//! 1. runs every check below — the state machine's, the interior gap, the trailing
//!    void — because a mutation that cannot commit must not be put in front of a
//!    reviewer (`api::rest::publish` makes the same argument about its own submit
//!    arm);
//! 2. looks for an **approved** unit over this window *and this content*;
//! 3. finding none, writes **nothing at all** and answers
//!    [`WindowMutationOutcome::SubmittedForApproval`] — the route opens the pinned
//!    unit through `ApprovalService::submit_window_mutation` and answers 202;
//! 4. finding one, commits under it, and the audit record carries its
//!    `approval_ref`.
//!
//! **All four acts run the same four steps.** For a `POST` (a schedule) and a
//! **lengthening** `PATCH` what puts them on step 3 is not the trigger list but
//! [`crate::domain::materiality::evaluate`]'s answer over the tenant's configured
//! policy, read inside this transaction through
//! [`crate::infra::threshold::effective_policy_at`] — the `_at` form, at the instant
//! the act's own stamp carries, never the `Utc::now()` wrapper. Under D-188 a version
//! is not the policy before its `effective_from`, so a mutation that read the wall
//! clock while stamping some other instant could decide a verdict against a policy
//! the record it wrote says was not yet in force. `api::rest::windows` stamps from
//! `Utc::now()`, so no route reaches that; an in-process caller holding a fixed stamp
//! does, and every service-level suite is one. `infra::threshold`'s own doc states
//! the rule this obeys, and `api::rest::publish` obeys it with the submit's instant.
//!
//! What that means concretely, because it is narrower than "a schedule may now need an
//! approval": a window mutation moves an interval and no money, so **every row of its
//! change set has a delta of zero** and no bar can be reached. The only rule left that
//! can answer is `inst-mat-percurrency`'s fail-safe half — *"a row whose currency has
//! no threshold entry is material"* — and its consequence is exactly the design set's
//! own bootstrap: a tenant that has configured nothing has every act material,
//! including these two.
//!
//! **The verdict is minted in one place and it is not here.** `Op::registered_trigger`
//! hands over *which act this is* (D-176: decided inside the transaction, against the
//! stored row) and the evaluator decides *what that means*. The constant this module
//! used to write — `MaterialityReason::AlwaysMaterialTrigger` on the controlled arm —
//! was true of D-62's two and would have been a lie about the other two, which reach
//! that arm because a threshold rule answered.
//!
//! **What a refused act cannot yet do, reported rather than papered over.** A
//! materially-refused `PATCH` or `DELETE` completes: the window id is in the path, so
//! the call made after an independent approve finds its own unit. A materially-refused
//! **`POST`** does not: the window id is minted per request, so the second `POST` names
//! a different subject and opens a second unit rather than finding the first approved.
//! The refusal direction is safe — nothing is written either way — and the remedy is a
//! decision about what a *schedule* unit's subject is (a caller-supplied window id, or
//! the `price_unit` kind that has no writer), which is not a code group's to take. The
//! reachable operator sequence is the design set's own: configure a threshold policy
//! first, and a schedule commits on one principal.
//!
//! # The 503 from the unconfigured registry is the expected answer here
//!
//! The module boots with `UnconfiguredCatalogVersionRegistryV1` unless
//! `CatalogVersionSource::LocalDevInventedVersions` is configured, in which case
//! `LocalDevCatalogVersionRegistryV1` answers instead. Under the default every
//! mutation rolls back at step 2 exactly as a plan publish does, and the tests
//! assert the arm was **reached**. The local implementation stays opt-in because
//! a gear inventing versions is a second incrementer, which `pricing-sdk`'s
//! registry contract refuses outright.

/// [`refuse_trailing_void`] runs on a cancel or a `PATCH` because its floor is
/// `max(current coverage end, now + margin)`, which no addition can cross. This
/// floor is different: it is anchored on the **row's** horizon, not on the key's
/// current coverage, so a key can be *authored* below it. The reachable shape is
/// a **schedule** — the first bounded window on a grandfathered key whose row
/// carries a horizon — and an extension that moves the end without reaching the
/// floor is the second. Neither is a coverage removal, and both leave subscribers
/// uncovered inside their own bound period. So this is asked of the interval set

/// **Its reach is those three acts and not every window mutation in the crate.**

/// sweep all write through `window_repo` without passing here;
/// [`window_repo`](crate::infra::storage::repo::window_repo)'s module roster names
/// each and says which are argued shut and which carries a bound of its own.
/// Retirement is the second kind: its cancellations are judged by
/// [`strand_free_disposition`](crate::domain::retirement::strand_free_disposition),
/// which asks this same span through the same walk and answers by **keeping** the
/// window rather than refusing the act — the two surfaces differ in what the act
/// *is*, not in what the bound says.
///
/// # The refusal reuses `WINDOW_TRAILING_VOID`, and that is a reading
///
/// §5 declares no code for `inst-co-bounds`; D-04's own step glosses the refusal
/// as *"`WINDOW_HISTORICAL_IMMUTABLE`/`CUTOVER_GAP` semantics"*, and neither fits
/// a schedule or an extension. `WINDOW_TRAILING_VOID` is declared as *"names the
/// key and the first uncovered instant"* — this refusal's exact shape — and D-80
/// records the three margins (its horizon, this bound, `inst-fg-trailing`'s
/// floor) as **one** margin under three anchors. Minting a fifth window code
/// would be this crate declaring a wire fact the design set does not, which
/// D-204 clause (2) explicitly refuses to do. The naming question is reported as
/// owed rather than answered here.
///
/// # It is a span and not a last instant, and that took a second reading
///
/// The bound was first built as one comparison — `coverage_end >= floor` — which
/// answers only where coverage **stops**. An interval satisfies it whatever
/// instant it *starts* at, so `[grandfatherUntil + 60d, floor + 365d)` passed:
/// coverage ran a year past the floor and the generation held no window at all
/// for the two months before it. Every neighbouring guard is silent on that
/// shape, each for a reason it states itself. [`refuse_interior_gap`] walks each
/// window's exclusive end to its successor's start, so a **leading** void has no
/// predecessor to open it from. [`refuse_trailing_void`] runs only on the two
/// coverage-removing acts, and a schedule is not one. And this rule read the far
/// end. The identical hole was in the null-horizon arm, where
/// [`CoverageEnd::OpenEnded`] is likewise a property of one interval's end.
///
/// So the question is asked of the whole span the generation is answerable for,
/// `[max(cohort, now), floor)`, and the refusal names the first instant of it
/// that nothing covers.
///
/// **The lower anchor is the cohort**, because that axis *is* the cutover instant
/// (ADR-0002) and a generation cannot strand anybody before it exists — the copy's
/// window is scheduled *at* the cutover instant, so a freshly composed cutover
/// whose instant is still a few minutes out is covered from its own first instant
/// and not from the operator's clock. **`now` raises it**, because a void strictly
/// in the past is not repairable by any window mutation — no interval can be
/// authored backwards over it — and a floor anchored on it alone would freeze
/// such a key against every further change, including the ones repairing its
/// future.
///
/// # What this does **not** cover
///
/// A grandfathered row that is still a **draft** carries no published generation
/// on the key, so there is nothing here to judge; the publish pipeline's coverage
/// rules own that world and do not check this bound either. Reported.

/// # Two callers, and the second one moves the operand this one reads
///
/// The span this rule asks about is `[max(cohort, now), grandfatherUntil + margin)`,
/// so its **right-hand end is the horizon** — the very column

/// One **shortened** window's audited interval, as an act whose subject is not the

///
/// # Why this exists beside [`window_state_value`] rather than being it
///
/// The two answer to different readers. `window_state_value` belongs to a record
/// whose `subject_ref` is [`audit_repo::window_ref`] — plan and **window id** — so a
/// reader already holds the window's durable name and what the state adds is the row
/// it prices. The cutover's and the supersession's records name an **act**
/// (`cutover_unit_ref`, `supersession_unit_ref`): three price ids and an instant, and
/// no window id anywhere, because a window id is not a component of either act's
/// identity. A reader of one of those records who wanted the shortened window would
/// have nothing to look it up by.
///
/// So the identity carried here is `(scopeKey, effectiveFrom)`, and both halves are
/// chosen rather than convenient:
///
/// * **`scopeKey`** is what the frozen delta keys a window plane by
///   ([`crate::domain::window::WindowInterval`] deliberately carries no `window_id`,
///   and that doc argues why it must not start), so a record keyed this way is
///   comparable against `read_model_repo::delta_at` without either side learning the
///   other's identifier. `tests/sqlite_cutover_unwind.rs` asserts they agree.
/// * **`effectiveFrom`** can never move. The append-only trigger
///   (`pricing_price_window`, arm 4) refuses any `UPDATE` that changes it — *"only state,
///   `effective_to` and the flip timestamps may move"* — so it names one interval of
///   the key for as long as the row exists. `effectiveTo`, the operand this record
///   exists to preserve, is precisely the column that does move, which is why it
///   cannot also be part of the name.
///
/// # It is a value, and that is the whole point (D-327)
///
/// A digest here would satisfy the appearance of a before-image and none of its use.
/// D-05 requires a retirement to restore the predecessor's `effectiveTo` *"to its
/// recorded pre-cutover value"*, and `grandfather::horizon_state_value` states the
/// same reason one plane over: a trail carrying a hash *"could not answer what the
/// horizon was, which is the whole operand D-327 found missing on the window plane."*
/// This is that operand.
///
/// `state` is in it although a shorten never moves it. It is what makes the pair
/// self-describing — a reader finding `before_state` and `after_state` differing in
/// exactly one field can see that this act moved an end and nothing else, rather
/// than having to know it — which is `horizon_state_value`'s argument for carrying
