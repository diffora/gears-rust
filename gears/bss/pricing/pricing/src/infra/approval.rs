//! The approval workflow, as the surfaces will drive it: open a pinned unit,
//! decide it, and record the attempts that were refused.
//!
//! [`crate::domain::approval::decision`] holds the judgement and is pure;
//! [`crate::infra::storage::repo::approval_repo`] holds the store and judges
//! nothing. This is the layer in between, and it exists for the three things
//! neither of those can do: re-derive the pinned subject from the database,
//! commit the decision, and **write the attempted-violation record**
//! `inst-tp-selfaudit` requires.
//!
//! # `approval_repo` takes the `AuditStamp` now, and the trail is complete
//!
//! The phase's Global Constraints say every mutating repository call takes one.
//! `approval_repo::open` and `decide` did not, which G2 reported rather than
//! absorbed: `AuditAction` declared no `submit`, `approve`, `reject` or
//! `withdraw`, so a stamp threaded there would have named a record those
//! functions cannot write. The tokens and their writers landed together, so both
//! functions take a stamp and both append inside the transaction that mutates —
//! see `approval_repo`'s own module doc. What is left here is the `deny` record
//! of a refused attempt, and the two rulings this group owed on it.
//!
//! # The denial record is written in the judgement transaction, because that
//! transaction commits
//!
//! A second transaction for the record would be paying a crash window for a hazard
//! that does not exist. The argument for one runs: the decision happens inside one
//! transaction — read the record, re-assemble the subject, judge, swap — and a
//! refusal makes that transaction *roll back*, so a record written inside it would
//! be a record that never existed.
//!
//! **A refusal does not roll that transaction back.** [`judge`] returns
//! `Ok(`[`Outcome::Refused`]`)` — a refusal is the transaction's *answer*, not
//! its failure — and `in_transaction` commits on `Ok` and rolls back only on
//! `Err` (`toolkit_db::secure::SecureConn::in_transaction`). The refusal path's
//! transaction commits.
//!
//! So the record is written **inside** [`judge`], on the refusal branch, before
//! the outcome is returned. It needs no `SAVEPOINT` (there is nothing to undo: the
//! swap has not run and the transaction has done nothing but read), no second
//! connection and no outbox row, and there is no window between the two: the
//! judgement and its `deny` record commit or fail together.
//!
//! What the reversal does **not** change:
//!
//! - **A refused decision still leaves the unit exactly as it found it.** The
//!   swap is on the other branch; the refusal branch's only write is the record.
//! - **A record that cannot be written still fails the whole decision.** It
//!   fails it harder, and better: the append's error is an `Err` out of `judge`,
//!   so the transaction rolls back and `decide` answers 500 rather than a clean
//!   403. An attempt this gear could not record must not be reported as though
//!   the trail were complete.
//! - **`inst-tp-selfaudit` is still satisfied** — *"rejected **and** written to
//!   `pricing_audit_log`"* — and now by a single commit rather than by two that
//!   a crash could separate.
//!
//! The three previously-examined alternatives are moot. Writing the record
//! *before* judging is still wrong for its own reason (the refusal is not known
//! until after the re-derivation, and a record written for every decision would
//! have to be retracted on the append-only store whose triggers forbid exactly
//! that), and it is not what this does: the record is written after the
//! judgement, in the same transaction.
//!
//! # Ruling 2 — the `deny` record's before/after pair is **ratified**, and it is
//! now the plane's shape rather than one action's exception
//!
//! The pair is not an exception peculiar to `deny`: **no** record on the
//! approval plane is about a change to the
//! subject. An approve, a reject and a withdraw are all judgements *about* content
//! that stood still, so every one of them renders the **unit** rather than the
//! subject — `approval_repo::append_trail` writes the unit's state before and
//! after the flip. The `deny` pair is the same reading with the one difference the
//! act forces, and it is ratified as written:
//!
//! - `before_state` — **the record as it stood**: its state, its subject and its
//!   submitter. An auditor needs to know which unit was attacked.
//! - `after_state` — **the attempt**: the code it was refused with, the decision
//!   that was asked for, and the principal who asked.
//!
//! The asymmetry is load-bearing and is why the pair is not simply
//! `append_trail`'s. There is no "after" state of the unit to render — the swap
//! never ran and the row is byte-identical to `before_state` — so a pair rendered
//! the sibling way would be the same object twice, and a reader could not tell a
//! refused attempt from a decision that changed nothing. The refusal has to go
//! somewhere, and the `after` half is the only half free to hold it.
//!
//! `approval_ref` carries the approval id, so the record joins to the unit
//! without parsing the subject.
//!
//! # The TOCTOU void hangs off the two audit choke points, and off one more
//! call site
//!
//! [`void_pending_units_of`] is called from
//! [`record_revision_mutation`](crate::infra::storage::repo::plan_repo) and
//! `price_repo`'s `record_price_mutation`, which between them are the audit
//! writer of every authoring mutation of a plan's shape or rows — and from
//! `plan_repo::open_revision`, which is neither.
//!
//! **The void is not inherited, and a surface added later has to be checked.** The
//! inheritance argument runs: every mutating repository call takes an `AuditStamp`
//! and lands a record, therefore a surface added later cannot mutate a pinned
//! subject without passing through one of those two functions, therefore it
//! inherits the void. The middle step does not hold — landing a record and landing
//! it *through those two functions* are different obligations, and the crate
//! contains four writers that honour the first without the second: `create_draft`,
//! `create_draft_on`, the publish commit, and `open_revision`, which inserts a
//! revision row, copies three child tables and appends its own `Create` record.
//! Three of those are argued exceptions; the fourth is the one an argument of this
//! shape hides, by saying it cannot exist.
//!
//! So the placement is kept for what it is actually worth — nine surfaces
//! covered by two call sites instead of nine — and the claim it was justified
//! with is replaced by an obligation on the reader: a **direct** audit writer is
//! a void site to be decided about, and the enumeration in
//! [`void_pending_units_of`]'s doc lists every one of them with its decision.
//! A later slice inherits the void only where it goes through the rail.

/// | `create_price` (`POST /plans/{id}/prices`) | yes | Adds a row to the candidate set the pin covers. |

/// | `delete_price` (`DELETE …/prices/{id}`) | yes | Removes a pinned row. |

///   plan prefix, so it cannot reach a unit over another revision or another
///   subject of the same plan;
/// - **`plan_repo::create_draft` / `create_draft_on`** — the `create_plan`

/// is that there is **no unaudited mutating entry point**. Calling this from
/// those two covers nine surfaces at two call sites, which is nine fewer chances
/// to forget.
///
/// It does **not** follow that a surface added later cannot mutate a pinned
/// subject without passing through them. `open_revision` is the standing
/// counter-example: it writes its own record and is outside the rail, reached
/// from `PATCH /bss-pricing/v1/plans/{planId}` whenever the plan has no open
/// draft. The obligation is therefore on the reader and is stated as one: **a
/// path that appends its own audit record is a void decision to be taken**, and
/// it belongs in the table above with its answer either way.
///
/// # Errors
/// [`RepoError::Db`] on a scope or storage failure. It runs inside the
