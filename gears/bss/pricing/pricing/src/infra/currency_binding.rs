//! Resolving `inst-cb-addon`'s inputs from storage — the add-on coverage
//! `domain::currency_binding` judges.
//!
//! `infra::bundle::referencing_markets`' shape one plane over, and for its
//! reason: the rule is a property of **other plans'** published rows, so a pure
//! walk over one plan shape cannot have it, and the rule set runs twice on one
//! publish — a rule reaching for storage itself could answer differently in the
//! two runs for no authored reason. So the read happens once, in
//! `infra::publish::rule_params`, through this function.
//!
//! # An add-on is named by its SKU, and resolved through the plan that sells it
//!
//! `AddonRule::addon_sku_id` is a **registry** SKU id, not a plan id — S2 keeps
//! it that way deliberately, so a composition survives the add-on being
//! re-planned. What has coverage, though, is a *plan*: rows hang off `plan_id`.
//! So the resolution is `sku_id -> current plan revision -> its published rows'
//! markets`, and an add-on SKU no plan in this tenant sells resolves to **no**
//! coverage rather than to an error.
//!
//! That last part is the fail-closed reading and it is deliberate: an add-on the
//! catalog cannot resolve is one a subscription could not resolve either, so a
//! required add-on naming an unsellable SKU should block the publish — which is
//! what an empty coverage set makes it do.
//!
//! # `published` only, and the eligibility narrowing is the domain's
//!
//! Only `published` rows are coverage, because a draft is not something an order
//! can resolve against. The `existing_grandfathered` narrowing is applied by
//! `domain::currency_binding::sold_markets` on the selling side and mirrored here
//! on the covering side, so the two sides of the comparison mean the same thing —
//! a grandfathered row of an add-on is no more a coverage candidate than a
//! grandfathered row of the plan.
