//! The membership plane's publish commit — `dod-customer-group`'s "every
//! committed membership mutation MUST be its own publish unit through the
//! Foundation engine" (`design/09-price-overlays.md:472-473`).
//!
//! # Why this is small where [`crate::infra::overlay_publish`] is not
//!
//! An overlay publish is seven steps because the thing being published is a
//! **draft revision**: it has to be re-read and re-validated against a world
//! that may have moved since it was authored, flipped `draft -> published`,
//! and its predecessor superseded, all inside the transaction that requests
//! addressability. A membership mutation has none of that shape. There is no
//! draft table (`inst-mm-pending`, §3: "memberships have no `draft` state"),
//! so there is nothing to re-validate against a moved world and nothing to
//! flip — [`group_membership_repo::enroll`] / [`group_membership_repo::end_membership`]
//! already validate and write in one call, and they already write their own
//! audit record (`inst-mm-audit`). What is left for this module is exactly
//! two of the overlay's seven steps: request a `CatalogVersion`, and record
//! one pending ref per subject.
//!
//! # Every method here takes a runner, and opens no transaction of its own
//!
//! Unlike [`crate::infra::overlay_publish::OverlayPublishService::commit`],
//! which owns its transaction, every method here is a `_in`-style function
//! over the caller's own runner —
//! [`crate::infra::window::WindowService::schedule_in`]'s shape and reason:
//! `POST …/members` and `POST …/move` carry a **required** `Idempotency-Key`
//! (§5), so their transaction has to be the one
//! [`crate::infra::idempotent::guarded`] opens around its claim — a service
//! that opened a second transaction of its own could not be called from
//! inside that closure at all (`toolkit_db` refuses `Db::conn()` inside an
//! open transaction, `infra::idempotent`'s own module doc). `PATCH
//! …/members/{id}` carries no idempotency key (it is guarded by `If-Match`
//! instead) and opens its own transaction directly at the route.
//!
//! # Ordering: the mutation runs before the registry is asked
//!
//! [`crate::infra::overlay_publish`]'s module doc states the registry-request
//! rule: ask only **after** every check that can still refuse, because a
//! refusal after the handle is issued leaves a pending version nothing ever
//! commits (`commit_overdue` for a publish that never happened). For an
//! overlay the checks are separable from the write; for a membership row they
//! are not — `enroll`/`end_membership` validate and write atomically — so the
//! rule is applied at that granularity instead: the repository call runs
//! first, and the registry is asked only once it has returned `Ok`.
//!
//! **Six of the seven publish units request before writing and cite D-156 for
//! it; these three do not**. Filed as a deviation
//! rather than a defect, and the two facts that make it one are worth stating
//! here rather than left to be re-derived at each of the three sites:
//!
//! * **A registry failure loses the write.** Every method here runs inside a
//!   caller-owned transaction — `api::rest::customer_groups` hands `txn` down
//!   from the idempotency gate — so a `registry_failure` returns `Err` through
//!   that closure and the enroll or the end rolls back with it. The ordering
//!   buys no durable row without a handle.
//! * **Every refusal already precedes the request.** `MembershipOverlap`,
//!   `MembershipConflict`, `StaleRowVersion` and `GroupUnknown` are all raised
//!   by the repository call above it — which is the property the sibling
//!   ordering exists to buy, reached from the other side.
//!
//! What the deviation does cost is a handle requested for an act that then
//! fails at `record_ref`. The request ids are deterministic
//! ([`enroll_request_id`], [`end_request_id`], [`move_request_id`]), so a retry
//! is answered with that same handle rather than stranding a second one, and
//! the registry is idempotent on the id.
//!
//! # This is the audit-only path only (`inst-mm-renewal`)
//!
//! Every method here commits directly and opens no approval unit. The
//! material path — `inst-mm-immediate`'s explicit re-resolution and
//! `inst-mm-bulk`'s always-material group move — needs the payload-in-
//! `pricing_approval` shape `inst-mm-pending` describes and is a separate,
//! not-yet-built task. Building it here would mean un-refusing
//! `AuditSubjectKind::Membership` in `approval_repo::subject_aggregate` and
//! `infra::approval::re_derive`, which this module deliberately leaves exactly
//! as they stand.
//!
//! # No outbox event, and that is the design set's own words
//!
//! §7 states the membership half of D-06 explicitly: a publish unit "requests
//! `CatalogVersion` addressability and warms the read model **without a
//! dedicated event**" — consumers observe `CatalogVersionPublished` plus the
//! warmed content, never a wire name of their own. The overlay plane later
//! gained one (`PriceOverlayPublished`, D-248) as an explicit,
//! separately-decided amendment to that same paragraph; no analogous decision
//! exists for membership, and `CatalogEvent`'s fourteen names are a **frozen**
//! set enforced by `chk_pricing_outbox_event_name` — widening it costs a
//! migration that rebuilds the table on `SQLite` (``pricing_outbox``'s own
//! account) and is exactly the "add a variant to a shared enum" this task was
//! told to stop and report rather than do. So this module never calls
//! `outbox_repo::enqueue`: not because the function is unavailable — it is
//! exactly as generic as `catalog_version_ref_repo::record_pending` — but
//! because there is no frozen name for it to carry.
//!
//! # No `void_pending_for_subject` either, and that is scope rather than oversight
//!
//! `overlay_repo`'s commit voids any approval unit still `submitted` over the
//! revision it just froze, because a draft revision can be re-submitted and
//! re-approved before it publishes, leaving an orphan behind. A membership row
//! has no draft-then-approve cycle in this task's scope — the audit-only path
//! opens no unit at all — so there is nothing an enrollment or an end could
//! orphan today. Task 6b, which opens membership approval units for the
//! material path, is where a void call would first have a subject shape to
//! target; inventing one now would risk guessing that shape wrong.
