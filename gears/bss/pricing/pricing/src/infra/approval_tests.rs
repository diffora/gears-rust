//! The three pure pieces of the workflow, proven where they are pure.
//!
//! The storage-backed half — that a real pending unit is really voided by a real
//! mutation, that a self-approval really lands a `deny` row — is
//! `tests/sqlite_approval_service.rs`, where there is a database to put rows in.
//! What is here is what needs none: how a subject ref resolves to a plan, which
//! regions a change set touches, and which wire refusal each judgement becomes.
