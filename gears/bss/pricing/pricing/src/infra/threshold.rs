//! The approval-threshold policy as a *composition of two stores* — which version
//! a tenant proposed, and which of those an independent principal approved.
//!
//! `pricing_approval_threshold` holds versions and knows nothing about approval;
//! `pricing_approval` holds units and knows nothing about thresholds. Neither can
//! answer "what is this tenant's policy", and neither should: a `state` column on
//! the version table would be a second answer free to disagree with the record that
//! decided it, and a threshold column on the approval table would put policy content
//! in a store whose whole shape is `content_hash` and no content.
//!
//! # `effective_policy` is the fail-safe, executable
//!
//! [`effective_policy`] answers `None` for a tenant with no approved version, and
//! `None` is what makes [`crate::domain::materiality::evaluate`] answer
//! `Material { NoConfiguredThreshold }` — `inst-mat-failsafe`, G1. Every step of
//! the walk fails in that direction:
//!
//! * a tenant that has proposed nothing has no versions to walk;
//! * a version whose unit is still `submitted` is not approved, so it is skipped —
//!   **a proposal does not take effect while it is being reviewed**, which is the
//!   whole content of D-10;
//! * a version whose unit was rejected, voided or never opened is skipped for the
//!   same reason and by the same read;
//! * a version whose rows no longer hash to what its unit pinned is skipped, and
//!   that one is worth its own sentence. `pricing_approval_threshold` refuses every
//!   `UPDATE` and every `DELETE`, but its primary key is
//!   `(tenant_id, version, currency)` — so an `INSERT` of a **currency the version
//!   did not have** is the one mutation of an approved version the store permits.
//!   Matching on the pin rather than on the version number is what makes that
//!   widening take the version out of effect instead of quietly extending what an
//!   approver signed;
//! * a version whose `effective_from` has not arrived is skipped — see below.
//!
//! # The fail-safe is a state a tenant can **return** to (D-185)
//!
//! Everything above is about reaching `None` by *failing*. There is one way to reach
//! it by **authoring**: the tombstone, a version that positively says this tenant has
//! no thresholds. [`effective_version`] answers `Some` for it — it is in force, and
//! it is a version an approver signed — and [`effective_policy`] answers `None`,
//! because [`ThresholdVersion::policy`] reads an empty entry set as the absence
//! `ThresholdPolicy::of_entries` says it is. So the two functions disagree on purpose
//! and the disagreement is the decision: *there is a version, and it configures
//! nothing*.
//!
//! It is not a way round D-10. The retirement is minted with the next number, pinned,
//! and reviewed by the same always-material unit every other policy diff rides
//! ([`ThresholdService::retire`]), so the principal proposing that the two-person rule
//! come back for everything is not the principal who grants it. And the walk treats it
//! as an ordinary version in every other respect: a later entry version supersedes it,
//! a future-dated tombstone is skipped like any future-dated version, and its rows
//! cannot move, the tombstone table refusing `UPDATE` and `DELETE` like its sibling.
//!
//! **What a reader above this module must not do is read `effective_policy`'s `None`
//! as "no version".** They are two states now — a tenant that never configured one,
//! and a tenant that authored `none` — and they are only distinguishable through
//! [`effective_version`]. The policy `GET` is the one surface that has to tell them
//! apart, and it does: `effective: null` against `effective: { entries: [] }`.
//!
//! # Why the walk is greatest-first and stops at the first hit
//!
//! A tenant's policy is its **latest approved** version, not the union of its
//! approved versions: a version is a complete entry set, so a currency dropped
//! between version 3 and version 4 has to actually disappear, and a union would
//! resurrect it. Descending order plus an early return says exactly that, and it
//! also means the ordinary case — the newest version is the approved one — costs
//! one iteration.
//!
//! # `effective_from` is authored, pinned, rendered — and now **read** (D-188)
//!
//! This section reported a divergence rather than fixing it: [`effective_version`]
//! answered the greatest **approved** version and compared its `effective_from`
//! against nothing, so a version approved with an `effective_from` a year out
//! governed *today's* publishes. The column was never decoration — it is inside the
//! approval pin (`content_pin` hashes it, deliberately, so an operator cannot move
//! when approved thresholds start applying after a reviewer signed) and the `GET`
//! renders it — which made the gap sharper rather than softer: **a reviewer signed an
//! instant that had no reader**, and one who signed "these looser bars start in 2030"
//! had authorized them starting immediately.
//!
//! **The direction was fail-open**, the only step of this walk that did not fail safe:
//! between approval and `effective_from` the tenant's policy is the design set's
//! *unset* state, so every change should be material, and instead each was thresholded
//! against a bar nobody had reached yet.
//!
//! It is now the walk's third skip, and the fail-safe direction is preserved by
//! construction rather than argued: a version whose start is ahead drops out, so the
//! tenant falls back to an older approved version — or to none, and none makes
//! everything material. Skipping (rather than stopping) is what keeps the fallback
//! from becoming a second failure: a walk that returned `None` on meeting a
//! future-dated version would take away a policy the tenant already had, tightening
//! where nothing asked it to.
//!
//! **Where the clock comes from.** [`effective_version_at`] takes the instant, and
//! [`effective_version`] is the `Utc::now()` wrapper over it. The comparison is
//! against "now" at read time by design — the same rows answer differently before and
//! after the instant, which is what an authored start *means* — and taking it as an
//! argument is what keeps the walk idempotent: one clock, one answer, however many
//! times it is asked. The publish route passes the submit's own instant, so the
//! verdict and the stamp on the unit it opens are about one moment; `infra::window`
//! and the policy `GET` read the wall clock, which for those callers is the same
//! instant to within the call.
//!
//! # The `If-Match` premise is this module's to refuse (D-186)
//!
//! §5 gives the policy row the Idempotency cell *"`ETag` + approval unit"*, and the
//! `ETag` half lands here rather than at the transport. `api::rest::preconditions`
//! draws the line and this side of it is the store's: *that* module refuses a
//! request it cannot understand, and this one refuses a request whose premise has
//! moved. The comparison therefore happens **inside** [`ThresholdService::propose`]
//! and [`ThresholdService::retire`]'s transaction, recomputed from the same two
//! reads [`state_at`] composes, and before a version number is minted — a
//! comparison in the handler would read the world, decide, and hand the decision to
//! a statement that races it.
//!
//! The tag itself has exactly one producer, [`ThresholdState::tag`], because the
//! `GET` that issues it and the transaction that tests it must agree to the byte:
//! a second derivation is free to drift, and a drift in either direction is either
//! a precondition nobody can satisfy or one that refuses nothing.
//!
//! The walk is bounded by the number of versions a tenant has ever proposed, which
//! is a governance act performed by a human through a two-person review. If that
//! ever stops being a handful, the remedy is an index-backed join and not a cache:
//! a cached effective policy is a threshold that keeps applying after the unit
//! authorizing it was withdrawn.
