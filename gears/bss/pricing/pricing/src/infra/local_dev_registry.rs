//! A **locally invented** `CatalogVersion` source, for deployments that have no
//! registry gear to talk to.
//!
//! # This is the second incrementer the SDK warns about, on purpose
//!
//! [`CatalogVersionRegistryV1`](crate::domain::ports::CatalogVersionRegistryV1)
//! says the Product & SKU registry is the **sole** incrementer, and that a version
//! the catalog invented locally "would make it a second incrementer, and two
//! incrementers make `CatalogVersion` unordered". That is exactly what this type
//! is. It exists because the registry gear is not in this repository yet, and
//! without *some* source every publish answers
//! `503 no catalog-version registry configured` — which takes the whole
//! publish-dependent half of the gear (windows, cutovers, supersessions,
//! repricing, migrations) out of reach, including on a stand meant to demonstrate
//! it.
//!
//! So the trade is stated rather than hidden: **a deployment that selects this is
//! choosing versions no registry issued.** The moment a real registry exists, any
//! version minted here is a version it never handed out, and two orderings meet.
//! Nothing here is safe to run beside a real registry, and nothing here should
//! outlive one.
//!
//! Three properties keep that trade auditable rather than invisible:
//!
//! * **It is opt-in by a value that says what it is.** Not a `true`: the config
//!   takes `mode = "local_dev_invented_versions"`, which cannot be set by
//!   accident and reads, in the deployment's own file, as the admission it is.
//! * **Every ref it mints is marked.** A pending ref is
//!   `dev-local-v{version}`, so `pricing_plan_revision.pending_version_ref` and
//!   every row that carried one can be swept for contamination later with a
//!   `LIKE 'dev-local-%'`. A registry-issued ref has no reason to look like this.
//! * **It says so on every boot**, at `warn!`, naming the mode. An operator who
//!   inherits the stand finds out from the log rather than from a version
//!   collision.
//!
//! # Why the clock and not a counter
//!
//! The version must be monotonic (`CatalogVersion` — "monotonic per tenant"), and
//! the two obvious counters are both worse:
//!
//! * **An in-memory counter re-issues versions after a restart**, which is worse
//!   than unordered — two different publishes would carry the same version and be
//!   indistinguishable rather than merely mis-sorted.
//! * **A counter in the gear's own tables** would need a migration, and the
//!   deployment this unblocks holds a live catalog. Adding schema to reach a demo
//!   is the wrong risk.
//!
//! Wall-clock milliseconds are monotonic across restarts without storing
//! anything, and a global sequence is monotonic per tenant by construction. The
//! one thing the clock does not give is strictness under load — two calls inside
//! one millisecond would collide — so the last issued value is held and the next
//! is `max(now, last + 1)`. That makes the sequence strictly increasing whatever
//! the clock does, including a backwards NTP step.
