//! The overlay plane's publish commit — D-234's option (b).
//!
//! `inst-pl-commit` promises an approved overlay becomes *"a publish unit through
//! the Foundation engine (D-06)"*. It cannot be one of that engine's units:
//! [`PlanPublishUnit`](crate::domain::publish::PlanPublishUnit) is plan-shaped in
//! every field — a plan id, one of its revisions, a kind discriminator — and both
//! its constructors name a plan fact. An overlay has no plan, so the second half
//! of `inst-pl-commit` is a **new pipeline** rather than a third constructor, and
//! this module is it.
//!
//! Riding the targeted plans' units was the other candidate and is wrong on the
//! design set's own terms: an overlay's lines may target several plans or none,
//! so there is no unit to ride — and D-112 added the tenant `overlay_index`
//! subject precisely because per-plan resolution gave overlay *enumeration* no
//! access path.
//!
//! It lives in `infra` rather than in `domain` because it holds an `AccessScope`
//! and repositories, which dylint DE0301 forbids inside `src/domain/**` — the
//! same reason [`crate::infra::publish`] and [`crate::infra::read_model`] are
//! here. It is a **separate module** from `infra::publish` rather than a second
//! service inside it, because that module's every line is about `PlanShape`.
//!
//! # What one act writes
//!
//! One transaction: the revision flip and its predecessor's supersession (which
//! `overlay_repo` makes atomic because §6 requires it), one
//! `pricing_catalog_version_ref` row **per subject** against one registry handle,
//! and — through the flip — the audit record. D-112 makes that two subjects, and
//! D-133 makes it three when a revision moves the scope value.
//!
//! **One handle, not one per subject**, and the reason is a pin: the registry
//! batches (D-47), so two handles of one act may resolve to two versions, and a
//! pin landing between them would resolve the overlay document as live while the
//! index shard at or below it still did not list it. `m20260802_000036` widened
//! the ref table's key so one handle can carry them.
//!
//! # The announcement, and why it was absent
//!
//! `PriceOverlayPublished` (D-248) is emitted at step 6, aggregated on the **overlay
//! id**. Until then this module carried a paragraph headed *"No outbox event"*,
//! arguing that the frozen `CatalogEvent` set named nothing overlay-shaped and that
//! **a wire event is the design set's to declare** (D-218's posture, one plane over),
//! so minting one here would be inventing surface — the same discipline as inventing
//! a wire code. That was right, and it is why the name arrived as a decision
//! extending `fr-event-contract` to fourteen rather than as a literal in this file.
//! The set turned out to be frozen in the **schema** as well, so it also cost
//! `m20260802_000060`.
//!
//! # Both halves of §4.2 are enforced, and the second arrived late
//!
//! The **content** pin keeps a reviewer's decision honest: what commits is what
//! was approved. The **second validation run** keeps the *world* honest: what
//! commits is still admissible against a state that has moved since the submit.
//!
//! The second was owed for one wave, recorded here and on D-234 as blocked
//! because the rule set's world came from `overlay_repo::world_for`, "which takes
//! a provider rather than a runner". That was true of the wrapper and of nothing
//! else — every fact reader underneath it had always taken `&impl DBRunner` — so
//! the fix was to split out `world_on` and call it on the transaction. The
//! premise was narrower than the entry recording it, which is why it is stated
//! here rather than quietly closed.
