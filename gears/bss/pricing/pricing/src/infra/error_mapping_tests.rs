//! Exhaustive `DomainError` → `CanonicalError` ladder check: every variant maps
//! to its expected canonical category, and the fail-closed rejections carry the
//! agreed wire code. This locks the machine-readable error contract — the codes
//! are what a consumer branches on once the coarse category is known.
//!
//! **"Exhaustive" is enforced since 2026-08-20, and was a claim before it**
//! (review RUST-TEST-001): 24 of the 61 variants were never constructed anywhere
//! in this file, so a re-classification could land with the whole suite green.
//! The bottom of the file carries the census that makes the word true — an
//! exhaustive `match` no new variant compiles past, and a roster the case checks
//! the length and the distinctness of. Read its header before adding a variant.

// to its expected canonical category" and **24 of the 61 never appeared in this
// file at all** — `WithdrawForbidden`, whose whole contract is that `reason`
// carries the bare code; `CutoverGap`; `CutoverInstantPassed`;
// `GrandfatherLoosenForbidden`; `UsageLineAxisMismatch`; `BundleExistsOnPlan`;
// `PrecedenceDuplicate`; `OverlayIntervalOverlap`; `RetirePlanReferenced`;
// `MigrationCompleted`; `BulkValidationFailed`; `PriceRowAbsent` and twelve more.
// A variant could be re-classified — 403 to 409, a detail folded into `reason` —
// with the whole suite green, which is precisely the failure mode this file was
// written against and which it had already caught once for `WINDOW_OVERLAP`.
//
// The gate is in two halves and both are needed:
//
// * [`declared_status`] is an **exhaustive match**, so a new variant does not
//   compile until somebody says what the ladder answers for it. It is a
//   transcription of the *contract* — the status each class is typed at — and not
//   a second copy of the ladder: re-pointing an arm from `denied` to `aborted`
//   changes the real answer and not this one, which is what reddens.
// * [`one_of_every_variant`] carries a value per arm, and the case below asserts
//   the roster's length and that no two entries are the same variant. Adding a
//   variant therefore fails the length assertion until it is constructed here
//   too, which is the half a match alone cannot give.
//
// The per-code assertions above stay: this census asserts the *category*, and the
// wire code inside it is what a consumer branches on.
