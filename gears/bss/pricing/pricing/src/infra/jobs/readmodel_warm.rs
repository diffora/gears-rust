//! `ReadModelWarmJob` — the sweep, and the whole of §4.4's degraded path.
//!
//! The reconciliation **is** the re-drive. A publish commit leaves a pending
//! `pricing_catalog_version_ref` and no version; this pass asks the registry
//! what version each pending handle landed in, hands the answer to the
//! projector, and arrives again next tick for whatever did not complete. There
//! is no second mechanism: §4.4's "the warm re-drive continues past the SLO
//! with no bound" is this pass running again.
//!
//! # Why a pull, and why here
//!
//! `CatalogVersionPublished` is the registry's event (D-66) and there is no
//! broker in this repository, so an inbound port would be a trait with neither
//! producer nor caller. The pull is already contracted:
//! `CatalogVersionRegistryV1::committed_version`'s own doc hands the overdue
//! decision to the caller "since only it knows how long the ref has been
//! outstanding" — and the only thing that knows that is a sweep over
//! `requested_at`. [`crate::infra::read_model`] carries the argument and names
//! the entry point a registry event handler will hook to when the registry gear
//! lands.
//!
//! # Inert without a registry, and that is a requirement rather than a nicety
//!
//! With `UnconfiguredCatalogVersionRegistryV1` every `committed_version` call
//! answers [`CatalogVersionRegistryError::Unconfigured`]. The pass detects that
//! **once** and returns at **debug** — no alarm, no error, never a boot or
//! shutdown failure. The sibling ledger's `RateSyncJob` states exactly this
//! posture for its own unconfigured provider, and the e2e that boots this gear
//! without a registry depends on it: a pass logging an error every five seconds
//! would make that boot unreadable.
//!
//! # What "incomplete" means here, and why the re-drive needs no second query
//!
//! The projector finalizes a ref and writes its subject's delta **warm in one
//! transaction**, so a committed ref always has a warm delta and the state
//! "committed but unwarm" is not reachable. A version is therefore incomplete
//! exactly while it still has a **pending** ref — which is what
//! [`catalog_version_ref_repo::list_pending_for_tenant`] returns. The re-drive is
//! consequently the same read as the first warm, and this pass needs no
//! "committed but incomplete" scan at all. **Reported**, because the plan this
//! group was built from expected two reads and the finalize's position
//! collapses them into one.
//!
//! # The scan is bounded per tenant, and the bound is a fact the pass acts on
//! (D-163)
//!
//! One tenant at a time: `pending_tenants` finds the tenants holding a pending
//! ref, and each is then read and resolved on its own. The bound has to be per
//! tenant rather than per pass, because on a cross-tenant page ordered by request
//! instant one tenant's stuck backlog fills the whole budget and what it defers
//! is every **other** tenant's completions — their frontiers do not advance, so
//! their publishes are unpinnable because someone else's are.
//!
//! Both bounds then feed [`PassCoverage`]: a tenant whose page **filled**, or one
//! for which the registry **errored** on any ref, gets no completion decision
//! this pass. The pass still resolves and warms everything it holds; what it does
//! not do is count a subject set it knows is partial. The frontier lags, which is
//! the safe direction, and `pin_eligibility_overdue` is what says so out loud.
//!
//! **Two numbers and an order, and they are the owner's** — D-163 hands them to
//! §F.2 rather than choosing them. `jobs.pending_refs_per_tenant` defaults to the
//! 500 this module used to spend cross-tenant;
//! `jobs.pending_tenants_per_pass` defaults to 250, and past it the tail of the
//! tenant order is not swept at all. The order is ascending tenant id and is not
//! rotating, which would need a cursor no table in §3.7 carries. **Reported.**
//!
//! # The two alarms, and the sink that does not exist
//!
//! `pricing.catalogversion.commit_overdue` (§3.6) and
//! `pricing.readmodel.pin_eligibility_overdue` (§4.4) are the two Critical
//! alarms the design set names **by string**, and both names are taken from it
//! rather than invented.
//!
//! **The sentence that stood here said this gear has no metrics or alarm
//! facility at all, and Slice 4 falsified it.** `domain/ports/metrics.rs` and
//! `infra/metrics.rs` now carry the same port-and-adapter pair the sibling
//! ledger has, with a `PricingAlarm` roster. These two names are still a
//! `tracing::error!` under the named string — so what was *a missing facility*
//! is now **two Critical alarms sitting off a plane that exists**, which is a
//! smaller gap and a different one, and **D-238 closed it**: both names are on
//! `PricingAlarm::ALL` and both firings go through the port as well as to the
//! log. The log line stays because it is what the e2e boot without a registry
//! reads; the counter is what an alerting rule can see, and these two are the
//! gear's only **Critical** alarms — for a while, the only two not on its own
//! alarm plane.
//!
//! # The degraded mark has no home, and none is invented
//!
//! §4.4 says completion "clears the degraded mark", and **no table in §3.7 has
//! a column for one**: `pricing_read_model` has none, and `pricing_operator_flag`
//! is forbidden from carrying version state by D-85. So the mark is **derived**
//! — a publish whose ref is still pending *is* the degraded state, and
//! completing it clears the state by making the predicate false. That is
//! precisely §4.4's own "no new event name is introduced; consumers observe
//! completion via the marker". No column, no flag. **Reported as a gap.**
//!
//! # The two signals measure two waits, and the instant that separates them
//! (D-166)
//!
//! `commit_observed_at` on the ref row is **when this gear first saw the
//! registry's answer** for that handle. The sweep stamps it the moment
//! `committed_version` answers `Ok(Some(_))`, in a statement of its own, before
//! and regardless of whether the projection then lands. That placement is the
//! whole mechanism: the projector writes a subject's delta warm in the **same
//! transaction that finalizes its ref**, so "committed but unwarm" is not a
//! state this store can hold and the observation has to be **recorded** rather
//! than derived from the ref's committed-ness.
//!
//! With it the two Critical signals stop overlapping:
//!
//! - **`PlanPublishDegraded`** — the ref is still unresolved, its commit **has**
//!   been observed, and that observation is older than §1.2's **5s** propagation
//!   SLO (`config.jobs.readmodel_degraded_after()`). This is the condition
//!   `fr-publish-fanout-atomicity` states and the batching wait is now outside
//!   it by construction rather than by hope.
//! - **`pricing.catalogversion.commit_overdue`** — the ref is pending, **not yet
//!   observed committed**, past the max batching-delay SLO
//!   (`config.jobs.catalog_version_overdue_after()`). The registry has not
//!   answered.
//!
//! The two are disjoint over one clock, which is the defect they were: an
//! earlier version of this module measured **both** against the batching SLO —
//! correctly for its own information, having no post-commit instant — so an
//! operator could not tell "the registry has not answered" from "the registry
//! answered and the warm is failing", the one distinction
//! `fr-publish-fanout-atomicity` exists to draw. Nothing goes silent in the
//! split: the four `(pending?, observed?, age)` states each land on exactly one
//! signal or none, and either failing state also holds the frontier and is
//! reported by `pin_eligibility_overdue`.
//!
//! `commit_observed_at` is an **upper bound** on the registry's commit — the
//! observation lags it by at most one sweep pass — so the degraded signal is
//! **late rather than false**, which is the safe direction for a Critical. The
//! accurate form is the registry supplying its own commit instant with the
//! version, and that is the registry gear's owed half of D-163's adoption, not
//! something this gear can approximate any closer.
