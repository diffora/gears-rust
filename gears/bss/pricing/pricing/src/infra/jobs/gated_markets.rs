//! The gated-market gauge's refresher — D-246's missing half, on D-250's tick.
//!
//! # Why a job at all, and why not the warm sweep
//!
//! `pricing_tax_not_sellable_ga` is **catalog-wide**: "how many markets are gated
//! now". Every other path in this gear is per-plan, and D-246 records what that
//! cost — an un-dimensioned series written per pre-check is last-writer-wins across
//! every plan and tenant, so a tax-exclusive plan checked after one gating five
//! markets wrote `0` and cleared §7's alarm while those five stayed gated. That was
//! removed as a `[C]`.
//!
//! The instrument is therefore an **observable gauge**: the exporter asks for the
//! value at collection time and no publish claims to know other plans' state. What
//! the gauge reads is an `AtomicI64`, and this job is the only thing that writes it.
//!
//! A pass inside the read-model warm sweep was **declined** by D-246: the warm
//! path's whole contract is bounded per-tenant work (D-163 clause 2), and a
//! catalog-wide scan on it would make one tenant's backlog everyone's latency. A
//! dedicated task touches neither the warm path nor the publish path; its cost is a
//! second background task and a value up to one tick stale.
//!
//! # Why the callback does not do the read itself
//!
//! It cannot. `opentelemetry` 0.31 types the callback
//! `Box<dyn Fn(&dyn AsyncInstrument<T>) + Send + Sync>` — **synchronous**, with the
//! crate's own doc requiring it to complete in a finite amount of time — so a
//! database read inside it is not expressible, never mind advisable. D-246's decided
//! mechanism was measured before it was built and did not exist as stated; the shape
//! that survives is cache-plus-refresher, and this is the refresher.
//!
//! # Staleness is the trade, and it is stated rather than hidden
//!
//! The value is up to one tick old. D-250 takes the tick from
//! `window_activation_tick_secs`' reasoning: 60s is many orders inside anything that
//! moves this quantity, since a market gated on tax-category readiness moves when an
//! operator declares a category or the future Tax Engine answers — months, by the
//! PRD's risk table — while the read is a catalog-wide scan rather than an index
//! probe.
