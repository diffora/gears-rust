//! `WindowActivationJob` — the UTC activation/expiry sweep, and this gear's
//! first producer of any `PriceWindow*` event.
//!
//! §1.7's `WindowActivationJob`, verbatim: *"Coordination-lease singleton: flips
//! `scheduled → active` at `effectiveFrom` and `active → expired` at
//! `effectiveTo` (UTC, idempotent, ordered per `(tenant, plan)`), emitting
//! `PriceWindowActivated`/`Expired` from the outbox"*. One pass reads the two
//! due sets, orders the work, and flips each window with its event **in one
//! transaction**.
//!
//! # It is not a publish unit, and that is the design rather than an omission
//!
//! `inst-ws-publishunit` (D-99) makes every window *mutation* a publish unit —
//! validation, a pending `CatalogVersion` ref, a plan-subject re-projection —
//! and says in the same breath that **activation and expiry are not**: the read
//! model carries window **intervals**, so a consumer re-derives "active at `t`"
//! from a frozen interval and `now` crossing an `effectiveFrom` changes a truth
//! row and changes nothing projected. So this job requests no version, writes no
//! `pricing_read_model` row and calls no projector, and the assertion that it
//! does not is
//! `tests/sqlite_read_model.rs::an_activation_re_projects_nothing_and_the_frozen_delta_answers_anyway`.
//!
//! # What idempotence is made of here — three mechanisms, none of them a marker
//!
//! 1. **The due read.** [`window_repo::list_due`] selects on `state` as well as
//!    the boundary, so a second pass over the same instant matches zero rows.
//!    There is no "swept" column and no cursor; the state *is* the record of
//!    what has been done.
//! 2. **The `UPDATE`'s own predicate.** `window_repo::transition` carries
//!    `state = <expected>` and §4's condition into its `WHERE`, so a flip that
//!    lost a race matches nothing rather than trusting the read that preceded
//!    it.
//! 3. **The dedup key.** [`outbox_repo::price_window_transition_dedup_key`]
//!    covers `(window_id, transition)`, and the second row is refused by the two
//!    constraints that key reaches — `uq_pricing_outbox_dedup_key` and the
//!    `outbox_id` primary key derived from the same pair, either of which is enough
//!    and neither of which the driver's error class can name. So one flip produces
//!    exactly one event. This is the mechanism the coordination lease would
//!    otherwise have had to be, and a lease cannot be one: it can be lost.
//!
//!    The flip and the enqueue also share **one transaction**, which is a
//!    different guarantee and is worth not conflating with this one: it is what
//!    stops a committed flip from standing without its event. In a lost race there
//!    is nothing to roll back on the window side at all — the `UPDATE` matched zero
//!    rows — so `tests/postgres_window_activation.rs` proves "one flip, one event"
//!    and does not exercise the transaction; that property holds by the shape of
//!    [`WindowActivationJob::flip`] rather than by a test.
//!
//! # The alarm, and the sink that does not exist
//!
//! `pricing.window.activation_overdue` (Warn, §7) is the design set's string,
//! taken from it rather than invented. What is invented is nothing: **this gear
//! has no metrics or alarm facility at all** — the sibling ledger has
//! `infra/metrics.rs` and an event publisher with an alarm catalogue, and this
//! crate has neither — so a `tracing::error!` under the named string is the whole
//! of it. **Reported as a gap**, not stubbed behind a trait with no
//! implementation. (`readmodel_warm`'s module doc states the same for its two
//! Critical alarms; this is that statement applied, not re-argued.)
//!
//! ## Its condition is read off the due set, before the flip
//!
//! §7: *"a `scheduled` window past `effectiveFrom` (or an `active` one past
//! `effectiveTo`) **not yet transitioned** beyond the job SLO; the lease
//! singleton is stalled"*. "Not yet transitioned" is the state of the row **as
//! this pass finds it**, so that is where the condition is evaluated — a window
//! whose start passed an hour ago and is only being flipped now went an hour
//! untransitioned, whether or not the flip then succeeds.
//!
//! The alternative — alarm only on what the pass **failed** to flip — was
//! rejected, and not on taste: it goes silent on exactly the case §7 names. A
//! stalled singleton flips nothing at all, and the pass that eventually takes the
//! lease clears the whole backlog successfully; under that reading the outage
//! produces no signal, ever.
//!
//! What the alarm cannot see either way is a deployment where **no** replica
//! sweeps: the observer is the pass. A stalled *holder* is covered, because the
//! lease TTL frees the slot and the peer that takes it finds the backlog with old
//! boundaries; a stalled *deployment* is not, and no signal inside this crate
//! could be — that is what an external liveness probe is for, and it is reported
//! rather than papered over.
//!
//! ## The age threshold, and why it is a knob rather than a constant
//!
//! Without an age bound this alarm fires for every window whose instant merely
//! arrived between two ticks — once each, on the pass that behaved perfectly.
//! `jobs.window_activation_overdue_secs` is the bound, in the shape
//! `readmodel_warm` gives `catalog_version_overdue_after()`.
//!
//! **The design set names no value for it, and that is a divergence rather than a
//! reading.** §10 says the activation job's SLO *"rides the ratified NFR set
//! (2026-07-28, PRD §14)"*, and that set has no activation entry at all — its
//! rows are publish propagation, read latency, validation, event delivery,
//! currency floor and repricing throughput. So the deployment states the value
//! and the default is stated with its reasoning and nothing more: 300s, the
//! order of the ratified max batching delay (D-47), because a window that has not
//! flipped for five minutes is late by every other clock in this gear. Reported.
//!
//! # What this job does **not** write, and why that is finished rather than filed
//!
//! `pricing_audit_log` gets nothing. Two questions hide in that, and only the first
//! was answered when this was written.
//!
//! **Who.** Nobody: a time-driven flip has no operator to attribute, `inst-au-pii`
//! makes the audit actor a pseudonymous principal id, and inventing one would be a
//! principal that does not exist. [`SYSTEM_ACTOR`] is the nil uuid for that reason;
//! see its doc.
//!
//! **Whether a state change on a row retained ≥ 7 years needs a record at all,
//! whoever caused it.** It does — `dod-audit` is "every mutation MUST record
//! actor/timestamp/before-after", with no carve-out for machine-driven ones — and
//! the record exists, on the same retention horizon, in two places the design set
//! itself nominates: the row's `activated_at`/`expired_at`, which §6 labels *audit
//! timestamps*, and the outbox event, whose `enqueued_at` is when the flip was
//! performed. Nothing about a §4 flip is unrecoverable from those: the before-state
//! is a function of the after-state on a machine with one inbound edge per state,
//! and the boundary is on the row.
//!
//! What they do **not** give is the second half of `dod-audit`'s storage clause —
//! *append-only, tamper-evident*. The window row is protected by
//! `trg_pricing_price_window_append_only`'s column whitelist and not by a hash
//! chain, so the flip is durable and unattributable but not tamper-evident. That is
//! the residue, and it is stated rather than deferred, because deferring it would
//! be filing something as owed to a later group that **cannot be written today at
//! all**:
//!
//! * `AuditAction` has no `activate`/`expire` token, and the design set's own
//!   roster closes in both directions — a token with no writer is not declared, and
//!   **no writer without a token** (`05-governance.md` §6). This job would be a
//!   writer with no token.
//! * `subject_kind` includes `window` in the design set, while `chain_id`'s
//!   aggregate roster omits it in **both** places that roster is stated
//!   (`01-foundation.md` §3.7 and `05-governance.md` §6: *plan, overlay, payer,
//!   policy, bulk operation*). A window audit row therefore has a declared subject
//!   kind and no declared chain to hash into.
//!
//! So what is owed, and to whom: **two declarations from the design set's owner** —
//! an `action` token for a time-driven transition and a `chain_id` aggregate for a
//! window subject — before any group can write this row, G4 included. Reported as a
//! divergence. The phase plan puts `AuditSubjectKind::Window` with G4's writer and
//! does not consider the sweep's own case, which is why this paragraph exists.

/// `PriceWindowExpired`, and a consumer read a key held by two `active` windows at
/// once. [`sort_key`] cannot repair that: the losing row is not in the vector.
