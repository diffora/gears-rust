//! What the sweep decides without a database.
//!
//! The split is `readmodel_warm_tests.rs`'s: everything else this pass does is a
//! statement about rows in two tables and is proved in
//! `tests/sqlite_window_activation.rs`. What is left here is
//!
//! 1. the alarm string the design set names — an operator's runbook greps for it
//!    and, the alarms having no sink, the string *is* the artifact;
//! 2. the changeover order, which is a rule about which of two events a consumer
//!    reads first and would otherwise only be observable through two committed
//!    outbox rows;
//! 3. how much of one pass's page an activation read may take, which is the other
//!    half of that same changeover rule — the sort orders the pair, the budget is
//!    what guarantees both halves were read.
//!
//! A fourth used to be here: *that a pass which did nothing reports nothing*. It
//! constructed no job and never called `run`, so what it asserted was
//! `#[derive(Default)]` — and of six fields it named five. The property it was named
//! for belongs to `run` and is asserted of `run` twice, by
//! `a_second_pass_over_the_same_instant_is_a_no_op` and
//! `a_cancelled_window_is_due_for_nothing`, both against a store.
