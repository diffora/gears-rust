//! The price-history read (`inst-he-read`), and the projection an export
//! streams (`inst-he-export`) — Slice 12 §3 `algo-history-export`.
//!
//! # There is no history store, and that is the design
//!
//! `inst-he-nostore` is normative: this slice adds **no** new table. The
//! Foundation's `pricing_price` is append-only — a published row is never
//! updated in content, a repricing writes a successor row and a cutover writes a
//! grandfathered one — so the sequence of rows on a scope key already *is* its
//! price history. Everything below is therefore a read, and the only thing that
//! had to be built is the walk order, the page contract and the projection.
//!
//! # The actor is the row's own column, never the audit log
//!
//! D-12 split two surfaces that had been conflated. Price **history** is
//! plan/price data; the Slice-5 audit **trail** is a different store, read by
//! [`crate::api::rest::audit`], because its rows carry before/after states the
//! history read has no business carrying. **Both are `audit x read`,
//! Auditor-only** — this paragraph said the history read was `plan x read` and
//! "Finance holds it by construction", which its own route stopped being true of
//! when `/history` was recatalogued: it *is* the catalog audit trail, and filing it
//! under catalog read handed "who changed what, when" to every holder of
//! `plan x read`. The 2026-07-28 amendment to that decision closed the hole the split left:
//! the history record needs an actor, and the only lawful source is
//! `pricing_price.created_by` — the pseudonymous principal stamped on the row by
//! whichever authoring path wrote it. [`HistoryEntry::actor`] is that column and
//! nothing else, and this module never reads `pricing_audit_log`.
//!
//! It is worth saying what makes that a real constraint rather than a
//! preference: a join to the audit table would be *invisible* in the answers for
//! every row an ordinary authoring path wrote, because those paths stamp the
//! same principal in both places. What it would change is who may read the
//! surface, and that is not something the read gets to decide for itself.
//!
//! # What "chronological" costs, and where the cursor contract stops
//!
//! D-125 asks history for **commit order** specifically — it gives catalog lists
//! deterministic key order and history append order, and they are different
//! promises. `pricing_price` has no commit sequence, so the order here is
//! `(created_at_utc, price_id)` and `created_at_utc` is the *authoring* instant
//! the request carried. [`crate::infra::storage::repo::price_repo::PriceRepo::list_history_page`]
//! states the residue in full: a row whose transaction commits late becomes
//! visible behind a walk that has already passed its instant, and is not
//! returned. Closing that needs a monotonic sequence column assigned in the
//! writing transaction — `pricing_price_window.mutation_seq` is the shape — and
//! therefore a migration. **Reported, not papered over.**
//!
//! The index the walk wants — `(tenant_id, created_at_utc, price_id)` — does not
//! exist either; `pricing_price` is indexed on the plan and on the supersession
//! link. Over a >= 7-year history that is a sort of the tenant's whole row set
//! per page. Also a migration, also reported.
//!
//! # The SLO is not enforced here, and no guard pretends otherwise
//!
//! `inst-he-export` budgets p95 <= 5s per 100-record chunk, scaling linearly to
//! D-125's cap, which is why a 1,000-row page is an export shape and never an
//! interactive read. A latency percentile is measured against a populated store
//! under load; nothing in this module can decide it, and a check that asserted
//! it against an in-memory fixture would be asserting about the test machine.
//! What **is** enforceable is the shape that follows from it, and that is what
//! [`HistoryPageRequest::parse`] does: a caller naming no page size gets the
//! server default of 100 — the interactive read C-6 preserved — and one naming
//! more than the cap is clamped to it.
//!
//! # Effective dates
//!
//! `inst-he-read` asks for records "with actor and effective dates", and a price
//! row's effective dating is its `pricing_price_window` intervals (D-03 puts
//! that store in this gear). A row may hold **several** — a shortened
//! predecessor interval beside its successor's, a cancelled schedule beside the
//! one that replaced it — and §3 does not say which of them a single "effective
//! date" would be. So the entry carries them all, in `effective_from` order,
//! each labelled with its state: that is what the store holds, and picking one
//! would be inventing a rule the design set does not draw. Cancelled and expired
//! intervals are included for `window_repo::list_for_plan`'s reason — this is the
//! store's read and not the read-model projection, and an operator asking what a
//! price was effective for is exactly the reader who needs to see the interval
//! that was withdrawn.
