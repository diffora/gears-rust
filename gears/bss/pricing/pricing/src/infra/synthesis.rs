//! The `SnapshotSynthesizer` of §1.7 — the reads behind D-76's two tiers and
//! D-87's self-contained payload (`inst-sy-freeze`, `inst-sy-select`,
//! `inst-sy-payload`, `inst-sy-provenance`, `inst-sy-backdate`, `inst-ms-synth`).
//!
//! [`crate::domain::synthesis`] holds the rule; this module holds the queries and
//! the freeze. The split is the usual one, and here it earns itself twice over:
//! tier 2's query has no store to run against, so keeping the *rule* free of that
//! fact is what lets the rule stay tested while the read is absent.
//!
//! # Tier 1, and the one reader it needs
//!
//! "The `pricing_price` row, **current or superseded**, whose `PriceWindow`
//! covered `t` on that key". Every part of that is on one record:
//! `window_repo::list_for_plan` resolves each window's ten-axis
//! [`ScopeKey`](crate::domain::scope_key::ScopeKey) from `pricing_price` on read,
//! so the key match, the interval test and the row id all come from one query and
//! there is no join to get wrong.
//!
//! **Half-open, `[effective_from, effective_to)`.** An instant exactly at a
//! window's end belongs to the *next* window, which is the same rule coverage
//! uses, and `effective_to = None` is open-ended rather than missing.
//!
//! **Cancelled windows are excluded.** A cancelled window never took effect, so a
//! row it scheduled was never what rating resolved — including it would let
//! synthesis freeze a price the subscriber demonstrably never paid. `scheduled`,
//! `active` and `expired` are all admitted: what makes a window evidence here is
//! that its interval covered `t`, not what state the clock has since moved it to.
//!
//! **And the row behind the window must be `published` or `superseded`**, which is
//! clause 1 read literally. A claim about *windows* cannot stand in for that filter,
//! because it has to be about *rows*: `list_for_plan` is taken whole, over every
//! price row of the plan whatever its lifecycle, so a `draft` row's window is
//! admissible evidence and a row that never published can be frozen — labelled
//! `live_history` — as what the subscriber was paying.
//!
//! # There is no tier 2, and no seam held open for one
//!
//! Treating `pricing_historical_price` as merely unbuilt — [`select_for_key`]
//! passing an **empty** reference candidate set into the domain rule rather than not
//! calling it, on the argument that "the day the store lands only the query behind
//! it changes" — is a promise nothing intends to keep. `inst-bd-store` and
//! `inst-sy-backdate`, the instruction naming synthesis the sanctioned **consumer**
//! of the backdating path, are both out of the design set.
//!
//! **D-330 struck the flow, the store and that instruction.** There is
//! no day when the store lands, so the parameter is deleted rather than left
//! standing as a promise nothing intends to keep — `select_rows` takes the live
//! candidates alone. What is untouched is tier 1 (D-330 clause 3) and the
//! per-row `source` discriminator the tier was recorded under, which S11 §4
//! clause 2 keeps at one value.
//!
//! # The payload materializes what nothing can look up
//!
//! D-87 plus C-5. Two halves, and the second is the one that was missing when the
//! rule was first written:
//!
//! * **per resolved row** — the evaluable content, read off `pricing_price` and
//!   `pricing_price_tier_band`. The band table is the second read and it is not
//!   optional: `check_amount_placement` forbids **both** scalar money columns on
//!   a `graduated` / `volume` row, so a payload built from `pricing_price` alone
//!   priced those two kinds at nothing at all;
//! * **plan-level** — the billing descriptor set and the resolved entitlement
//!   grant set, without which the payload is row-complete and invoice-incomplete,
//!   because Billing has no `CatalogVersion` to fall back to on a
//!   `migrated-origin` ref by construction.
//!
//! **The grant set is empty and that is not a shortcut.** There is no entitlement
//! grant store in this gear — no table, no column, no domain type — so the
//! plan-level half lands descriptor-complete and grant-absent. It is reported
//! rather than silently omitted: the payload carries `grantSetUnavailable` so a
//! consumer cannot read the absence as "this plan grants nothing".
