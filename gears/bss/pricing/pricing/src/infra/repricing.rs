//! The mass-repricing run's apply lane — `inst-mr-apply`, `inst-mr-validate-scope`
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §3; D-134).
//!
//! [`apply_run_in`] is the writer that takes a run the rest of the way, and it is
//! called: `RunApplyWorker::apply` is the gear's one production caller, off the
//! request that accepted the run. Both accepting surfaces — `api::rest::repricing_runs`'
//! `open_repricing_run` for the non-material path, `api::rest::approvals` for the run
//! a second principal has just approved — hand the apply to [`RunApplyLane`], and
//! each has taken the run to `committing` before it does: `open_run`'s own
//! `advance_on_verdict` for the first, [`begin_committing_in`] for the second.
//!
//! **A module header describing built work as owed is this gear's standing defect**,
//! and this file has carried it: "a run that reached `awaiting_approval` or
//! `committing` stops there today" cites another doc rather than the writer sitting
//! in this same file. The call sites are the measurement, and grepping them takes
//! fifteen seconds.
//!
//! [`abandon_committing_run`] is what **spends** what the gentle exits preserve: a
//! run they leave `committing` has a door out, and an operator is the one who opens
//! it. A redrive route — letting a second `POST` under a spent `run_id` drive a
//! `committing` run forward again — is still owed, and the redrive-contract
//! paragraph below is the argument for it rather than a claim about a caller.
//!
//! # The shape, settled and not re-opened here
//!
//! Three decisions cost real time to establish and are taken as given:
//!
//! * Successor rows are written through [`commit_supersession`], **not**
//!   [`crate::infra::supersession::supersede_in`] — the latter's per-call
//!   registry request, outbox enqueue, audit append and materiality
//!   evaluation are exactly the four things a repricing run does once for the
//!   whole run (materiality, already built) or once per plan (the other
//!   three), never once per row.
//! * The row-local rule set is [`plan_supersession`], run once per row,
//!   unchanged from the interactive supersession's own compose step.
//! * One `CatalogVersion` per plan, requested once after every row of that
//!   plan has committed — never per row.
//!
//! # The order inside one plan's transaction
//!
//! 1. For every pending row of the plan: resolve the predecessor **fresh, in
//!    this transaction**, run [`plan_supersession`] (the row-local rules plus
//!    the touched key's window overlap/gap/trailing-void check) at
//!    [`ChangeoverMoment::Commit`] — the stricter, batching-delay floor
//!    `api::rest::repricing_runs`' own module doc names as belonging to "a
//!    commit that does not exist", which this now is — stage the successor
//!    draft, and write it through [`commit_supersession`]. The journal row
//!    flips `pending -> applied` and one audit record lands on the plan's
//!    chain, in the same transaction as the write it describes (D-14).
//! 2. **Once**, over the plan's row set **as this transaction just left it**:
//!    [`crate::infra::publish::assemble_from`] against the plan's current
//!    revision (never `assemble`, which demands an open draft a repricing
//!    plan does not have), [`crate::infra::publish::rule_params`], then
//!    [`run_publish_rules`]. This is the step Step 0 exists for — it depends
//!    on the transaction seeing the writes step 1 just made, uncommitted.
//! 3. On a violation: `Err`, and every write above rolls back with it. The
//!    caller marks every one of this plan's rows `failed` with the one
//!    reason, in a **separate** transaction — this module doc's own
//!    consequence, decided rather than discovered mid-build: a rolled-back
//!    transaction cannot also be the one recording that it rolled back.
//! 4. On success: one `CatalogVersion` request for the plan, `record_pending`
//!    against [`SubjectRef::Plan`], and — now that the pending ref exists —
//!    the two outbox events per row step 1 could not enqueue yet, each keyed
//!    `(run_id, price_id)` so a redrive cannot double-fire either.
//!
//! # What the aggregate pass actually guards here
//!
//! Step 2's re-run of `run_publish_rules` cannot fail *because of this run's
//! own effect*. A markup/discount/fixed adjustment moves only a row's amount,
//! and every rule `run_publish_rules` registers that reads `amount_minor`,
//! `package_price_minor` or `unit_price_minor` is row-local — already run,
//! pre-commit, inside [`plan_supersession`]'s own `price_row_rules()` call.
//! None of the genuinely aggregate-only rules (phase coverage, descriptor
//! completeness, region declaration, window coverage) is sensitive to an
//! amount's value at all. So for this lane the post-commit pass is not a
//! soundness guard over what this transaction just wrote — it cannot catch a
//! bad *repricing*, because a repricing has no way to produce one. What it
//! guards against is **concurrency**: that nothing *else* changed the plan's
//! structure between this run's row selection and this transaction's commit —
//! a phase dropped, a region retired, a stray draft authored on an untouched
//! key. That is a real property worth its cost even though this run's own
//! adjustment can never be the thing that trips it.
//!
//! # The bulk lock is taken here, on the run's own rows — and here is exactly
//! # what that does and does not close
//!
//! `inst-bs-commit` gives the run's bulk lock over its rows starting at entry
//! to `committing`, and D-134 leans on it explicitly. [`apply_run_in`] takes
//! it now, over the price ids [`repricing_journal_repo::pending_for_run`]
//! answers — this call's whole target set — on the same autocommit connection
//! every other run-level statement here already uses, never inside a plan's
//! own transaction: [`bulk_repo::take_locks`]'s own doc is explicit that it
//! must run outside one, because Postgres aborts an enclosing transaction on
//! the insert its own conflict path issues, which would degrade
//! [`RepoError::BulkRowLocked`] to [`RepoError::BulkLocksHeld`] and lose the
//! holder `fr-concurrent-edit` needs named.
//!
//! Releasing it is split across two mechanisms, because [`apply_run_in`] does
//! not treat its four ways of ending alike:
//!
//! * **A clean finish, and an ordinary [`DomainError`] this function's own
//!   code is still running to handle** — the two paths its own `match` can
//!   still reach. A clean finish calls [`finish_run`]: release the lock,
//!   tally, land the run terminal. An ordinary `Err` from lock-taking onwards
//!   — [`bulk_repo::take_locks`]'s own refusal included, which is why that call
//!   sits inside the same `inner` block as everything after it — does
//!   deliberately *less*: it releases the lock and returns, leaving the run
//!   `committing` with its unreached rows exactly `pending` —
//!   [`domain::bulk::JournalState`]'s own doc is explicit that this is what
//!   lets a second call tell "never reached" from "decided", and nothing
//!   about a plain storage hiccup should cost that. Force-landing the run
//!   terminal here would freeze every unreached plan `failed` with no
//!   redrive possible; leaving it `committing` costs nothing, because
//!   `bulk_repo::take_locks` is called unconditionally at this function's own
//!   top for a run already `committing` exactly as for one just entering it
//!   — a second call simply retakes the lock and carries on.
//!
//!   **The abort is the second call, and the redrive is still owed.**
//!   `apply_run_in`'s one production caller is `RunApplyWorker::apply`, which is
//!   asked only for runs that are already `committing` — the two accepting surfaces
//!   spend that edge before they enqueue. So what the gentle exit preserves is
//!   spent by [`abandon_committing_run`] (`POST …/repricing-runs/{runId}/abort`):
//!   the lock goes, the unreached rows are decided, and the run lands terminal on
//!   an operator's own decision. That turns "`committing` forever with its
//!   unreached rows `pending` forever" into a state with a door out.
//!
//!   **`awaiting_approval` is the one state left with no door, and it is not on the
//!   apply's path.** The abort guards on `committing` and refuses everything else,
//!   so a run that is still `awaiting_approval` can only be ended by a `reject` of
//!   its batch unit — and a unit already decided is refused `APPROVAL_NOT_PENDING`.
//!   Two windows reach that state: a `reject` whose own `awaiting_approval ->
//!   rejected` write fails after the decision committed
//!   (`api::rest::approvals::reject_repricing_run`, D-267's strand through a crash
//!   rather than through a missing edge), and an `approve` whose
//!   [`begin_committing_in`] fails after the decision committed. Both leave a run
//!   whose unit is decided and whose rows are `pending`, and both need the same
//!   capability: driving a run's state machine from inside `ApprovalService::decide`'s
//!   own transaction. That is a decision about where a bulk run's states are written
//!   from, and it is what makes the strand the bulk plane's rather than either arm's.
//!   Nothing on the *enqueue* path adds to it — a refused enqueue, a lost applier and
//!   a shutdown mid-apply all leave `committing`, which the abort reaches.
//!
//!   The **redrive** — letting a `POST` under a spent `run_id` drive a
//!   `committing` run forward rather than end it — would recover the rows instead
//!   of failing them, and is not built. It needs no *new* protection against
//!   `inst-co-single-pending`: [`RunApplyWorker`] already reaches this function
//!   arbitrarily later than the open's own `refuse_rows_on_a_held_key`, so
//!   [`refuse_targets_on_a_held_key`] below is the check every arrival goes
//!   through and a redrive is one more arrival. The abort needs none of it — it
//!   takes nothing and writes no price.
//! * **A panic, and a dropped future** — the two paths no code of this
//!   function's own ever runs for again. Only [`Drop`] is the language's own
//!   guarantee across both (review findings Z8-8/Z9-5 name the gap an
//!   `Err`-arm-only release like `infra::bulk`'s own sibling leaves: a panic
//!   unwinds past a match arm exactly as it unwinds past everything else, and
//!   a dropped future — a client disconnect, a shutdown signal, a losing
//!   `select!` arm — never runs *any* of this function's own code again,
//!   match arm or not). [`RunLockGuard`]'s `Drop` releases the lock and stops
//!   there, exactly as the ordinary-`Err` exit does: with the abort door mounted
//!   there is a decision an operator can make about the run, so inferring one from
//!   a dropped future buys nothing and costs the rows their `pending` state. The
//!   release leaves the dropping thread on [`RunCompensation`]'s lane — a task the
//!   gear's lifecycle owns and cancels — rather than on a detached spawn nothing
//!   supervises. See [`RunLockGuard`]'s own doc for what it can and cannot
//!   promise.
//!
//! **And the lock does not close the concurrency hole even taken exactly as
//! D-134 describes it.** Two facts, both established by grep rather than by
//! argument, drive this:
//!
//! * **No aggregate rule is amount-sensitive.** Every rule `run_publish_rules`
//!   registers was checked against `amount_minor` / `package_price_minor` /
//!   `unit_price_rate`: zero references. Every amount-touching rule is
//!   row-local and already runs pre-commit in `plan_supersession`. A
//!   repricing run changes only amounts and rates, so it cannot make a clean
//!   plan's aggregate pass fail by its own effect — that pass is a
//!   concurrency guard, not a soundness check over this run's own writes (see
//!   the section above).
//! * **The lock is narrower than the pass.** `take_locks` covers the rows the
//!   run *selected*; the aggregate pass's candidate set is the *whole plan's*
//!   published-and-draft rows (`CANDIDATE_ROW_STATES`, `src/infra/publish.rs:117`).
//!   A stray draft on a key the run never targeted sits outside any lock
//!   scoped to "the run's rows" — `tests/sqlite_repricing_apply.rs`'s own
//!   atomicity test exploits exactly that key, and the lock this task builds
//!   would not have prevented it: its insert never names a row the run did
//!   not select.
//!
//! So: this lock serialises interactive edits **on the run's own rows**
//! against this run, and nothing wider. Whether to narrow the aggregate pass
//! to the run's own keys, widen the lock to the whole plan, or accept the
//! residual as a standing property of `inst-mr-validate-scope` is a design
//! decision nobody has taken, and this module does not take it here —
//! narrowing the pass or widening the lock in code would be answering a
//! question the design set has not.

/// `committing` is the state a run stands in *while* this loop applies it, so
/// `POST /repricing-runs/{runId}/abort` ([`abandon_committing_run`]) can land in the
/// middle of a run this function is still working. The abort is unconditional by
/// design — an operator's door has to work every time — so the party that yields is
/// the one still working, and this is where it yields: the run's state is re-read
/// before every plan and after the last, and the loop stops the moment it no longer
/// reads `committing`.
///
/// What that prevents is not a lost write but a **concurrent** one. The abort
/// deletes D-134's lock rows and lands the run terminal; a third run over the same
/// price rows may then take those locks and start writing. An applier that carried
/// on would be writing successors into rows another run holds the lock over, having
/// itself no lock any more — the exclusion `inst-bk-lock` exists for, gone while
/// both writers believe they have it. The journal's freeze makes that visible only
/// afterwards, and only sometimes: the abort marks the rows it found `pending`
/// `failed`, so this loop's next `mark_applied` is refused and the plan's whole
/// transaction rolls back — but a plan whose rows a *third* run had already taken
/// over does not come back through this journal at all.
///
/// **The state read alone does not close it**, and that is measured rather than
/// reasoned about. The read sits outside the plan's own transaction, so an abort
/// landing between the two is invisible to it — and that is not a rare interleaving
/// but the *usual* one: the abort's own transaction can only start in a gap between
/// this loop's transactions, so it starts in the gap this read just left. With the
/// pre-plan check as the only guard, `an_abort_landing_mid_apply_stops_the_applier_at_the_next_plan`
/// fails.
///
/// So the yield has a **second half, on the plan's failure path**: a plan whose
/// transaction returned `Err` while the run has left `committing` is the abort's
/// doing, and the loop yields there instead of recording a failure. Nothing lands
/// half-applied in that window — the plan's transaction is one transaction, and the
/// swap refusal that ends it rolls its successors back with it — so what the second
/// half saves is not a write but the misreport: the plan's rows already carry the
/// abort's own reason, and re-marking them is refused for the same reason the plan
/// was — which is how an operator's clean abort turns into an `Err` out of the
/// apply.
///
/// Between the two, the applier stops at the first plan boundary after the abort
/// lands, and the run's finish belongs to whoever ended it.

///
/// [`apply_run_in`]'s own explicit tail [`disarm`](Self::disarm)s this guard

///
/// It does the one thing that cannot wait for an operator — release the lock, so

/// aborted or redriven — and stops there. Running [`finish_run`]'s force-terminal
/// sweep from here instead (mark every still-`pending` row `failed`, tally, advance
/// the run out of `committing`) costs those rows the one state that tells "never
/// reached" from "decided", on nothing better than a dropped future; the door that
/// spends that state (`POST …/repricing-runs/{runId}/abort`,
/// [`abandon_committing_run`]) is an operator's own decision, and it is the reason
/// a `pending` row under a run no caller will drive forward again is not
/// unreachable.
///
/// What that keeps is [`crate::domain::bulk::JournalState`]'s "an aborted run
/// leaves `pending` rows standing" — the property that lets a second call tell
/// "never reached" from "decided" — on every exit instead of all but two.
///
/// # What the fallback cannot promise
///
/// The release leaves this thread either way, because [`Drop::drop`] cannot
/// `.await`. With a [`RunCompensation`] handle it goes to a task the lifecycle owns
/// and joins; without one it goes to [`spawn_detached_release`]. Both are
/// best-effort rather than synchronous with the drop, so a caller that reads the
/// run back immediately afterwards may still see its locks held for a beat. And a
/// process killed outright runs neither: that residue is what the abort route is
/// for, which is why the route is deliberately retryable.
///
/// **It clears the lock rows the store holds when it runs, which is not always the
/// run's whole set.** [`bulk_repo::take_locks`] writes one independent statement per
/// row, and cancelling a future cancels the *await*, not a statement the driver has
/// already been handed — so a cancellation landing inside that loop can leave one
/// insert to complete **after** this release's `DELETE`. Measured, not reasoned
/// about: a saturated box reproduced a release that deleted one row of a two-row run
/// and a row of that same run standing afterwards.
///
/// The row is not stranded — it is held by a run that is still `committing`, so
/// [`abandon_committing_run`] clears it and a redrive's `take_locks` retakes it
/// (`holder == Some(operation_id)` is that function's success path). What it costs
/// until then is an interactive edit on that one price row.
///
/// **A retry loop here would cost more than it buys.** It would have to delete
/// again after re-reading, and the lock it deleted might be one a redrive had just
/// legitimately retaken — turning the idempotence `take_locks` was given for D-37's
/// redrive into a race against a sweeper. The bounded, already-built remedy is the

mod ordinary_failure_release {
    //! **The Critical review found and this pins.** [`super::release_lock_after_ordinary_failure`]
    //! is what an ordinary `Err` out of `apply_run_in`'s own `inner` block reaches — see the
    //! module doc's redrive-contract paragraph — and its whole contract is *doing less* than
    //! [`super::finish_run`]: release the lock, and touch neither the run's own state nor its
    //! journal, so a run left `committing` with a row still `pending` stays exactly that
    //! ([`crate::domain::bulk::JournalState`]'s own doc names why: that is what lets a second
    //! call tell "never reached" from "decided").
    //!
    //! **What this test is, and what it is not.** It is a unit of the release itself: the
    //! function is called directly and the lock is gone afterwards. That the *arm* reaches it —
    //! that an ordinary `Err` out of `inner` releases and stops, rather than landing on
    //! [`super::finish_run`]'s force-terminal sweep — is a property of `apply_run_in` and is
    //! pinned where the run can be driven whole, by
    //! `sqlite_repricing_apply::an_ordinary_failure_leaves_the_run_committing_with_its_rows_pending`.
    //! Asserting the run's state and its journal here would prove nothing either way: this
    //! function's whole body is the release, so it could not move them however it were written.
    //!
    //! **The `Err` that probe forces is a lock collision, not a lost race.** Timing a competing
    //! write against `apply_run_in`'s in-flight processing of the same row — the technique
    //! `tests/sqlite_repricing_apply.rs`'s cancellation tests use for a different property —
    //! cannot produce this one: this crate's `sqlite::memory:` harness gives every `DBProvider`
    //! a single-connection pool (`libs/toolkit-db`), and `SQLite`'s single-writer semantics mean
    //! a transaction holds that one connection for its whole duration, so a second task's write
    //! lands only in the gaps *between* transactions and a lock-visibility poll gets its turn
    //! after the target transaction has already finished. A sibling run holding the lock before
    //! the call has no such window: the collision is one statement's answer.
