//! The `ReadModelProjector` — what turns a committed `CatalogVersion` into
//! something a consumer can pin.
//!
//! G5's publish commit deliberately stops one step short: it writes the flipped
//! revision, the published rows, a **pending** `pricing_catalog_version_ref`
//! carrying its subject (D-157), an undrained `PlanPublished` and an audit row,
//! and **nothing** in `pricing_read_model` or `pricing_pin_frontier`. It cannot
//! do otherwise — that table is keyed `catalog_version NOT NULL` and the commit
//! holds a handle, not a number. This module begins there: resolve the handle,
//! project the subject it published, write the delta warm, and advance the
//! frontier if that completed the version.
//!
//! It lives in `infra` rather than in `domain` because it holds an
//! `AccessScope` and repositories, which dylint DE0301 forbids inside
//! `src/domain/**` — the same reason [`crate::infra::publish`] is here, and the
//! sibling ledger puts `infra::posting::service` here. The projected payload's
//! **vocabulary and rendering** stay pure, in [`crate::domain::projection`].
//!
//! # Where the version comes from: a pull, not a push
//!
//! D-66 settled the emitter — `CatalogVersionPublished` is the **registry's**
//! event, tenant-wide, and deliberately not in this gear's frozen event set.
//! `gears/bss/products` is docs only, there is no event broker in this
//! repository at all (`config.events_enabled` defaults `false` and says why),
//! so an inbound port defined here would be a trait with neither producer nor
//! caller.
//!
//! The pull is already contracted. `CatalogVersionRegistryV1::committed_version`
//! resolves a pending ref to its committed version, and its own doc hands the
//! overdue decision to the caller "since only it knows how long the ref has
//! been outstanding" — which is this gear's sweep over
//! `pricing_catalog_version_ref.requested_at`. That port was written for a
//! reconciler and had never been called.
//!
//! **When the registry gear lands, its event handler hooks to
//! [`ReadModelProjector::project_version`]** — this entry point, unchanged —
//! and the sweep stays as the backstop §3.6's own remediation posture already
//! asks for ("a `CatalogVersionPublished` batch that omits an expected pending
//! ref is treated the same; remediation is a registry re-request, never a
//! silent re-emit").
//!
//! # Three premises, each stated as a premise
//!
//! The [`crate::infra::publish`] posture, three times. Each is a place where
//! what is built and what the design set says are not the same thing, and each
//! is written here rather than reconciled by editing a document.
//!
//! ## 1. D-121's horizon is absent, and what holds it is that the set it
//! filters is empty
//!
//! D-121 projects "every price row of the plan whose window set intersects
//! `[projection_time - H, ...)`", `H = 2 x` the longest billing cycle sold on
//! the plan.
//!
//! **What changed on 2026-08-04, precisely.** The window store now exists and
//! [`project_windows`] reads it, so the *predicate has an operand*: this paragraph
//! used to say the predicate "cannot be evaluated at all" and that a literal
//! reading would project nothing, because no row had a window set. That half is
//! **false now** and is struck. A version this projector writes carries the
//! intervals, states and derived coverage end `inst-sg-surface` requires — which is
//! what predicate (1) needs *from the pin*, and is not the same thing as predicate
//! (1) being evaluable.
//!
//! **W6 is an input to sellability predicate (1), not the predicate.** §1.6's W6 is
//! a **term** — "the longest billing cycle sold on the key" — and predicate (1) is
//! "an **active** window covers `t` **with the D-80 coverage horizon**", a
//! conjunction over the frozen intervals, the reader's `t` and that term. Carrying
//! intervals, states and a coverage end supplies the first two operands and **not**
//! the term, so nothing here makes W6 evaluable and an earlier draft of this
//! paragraph claiming otherwise by apposition was wrong rather than loose.
//!
//! **Nothing in this tree produces the term**, and the ownership chain for it is one
//! chain rather than two. It is stated here because two documents in this group's own
//! diff used to name two different owners for one owed input — this paragraph named
//! `SellabilitySurface`'s group, `window_repo`'s deferred entry named G3:
//!
//! * **G3 builds the cycle set.** It owns `CoverageChecker` and the D-80 horizon,
//!   which is the same term under a different margin.
//! * **G4 wires it into `window_repo::adjust_effective_to`.** §6 requires the D-04
//!   bound enforced "at cutover and on every `effectiveTo` adjustment", and G4 owns
//!   that path and the routes that reach it.
//! * **G5 consumes it in predicate (1)**, which is where the D-80 margin is read.
//!
//! **The trap, recorded because the name is the trap.** W6 is *named* "the longest
//! billing cycle sold on the **key**" and is *defined* per **plan**: the longest
//! `frequency` among the plan's **recurring** rows on the key's
//! `(currency, region)`. §1.6 says so in as many words and gives the reason — a
//! `usage`, `one_time` or `one_time_setup` key carries no `frequency` at all, so the
//! literal per-key reading is undefined on most keys of a hybrid — and matches it to
//! D-121's own `H`. It is **zero** on a plan with no recurring part, where the
//! horizon predicate reduces to "an active window covers `t`". Whoever builds it
//! from the name alone builds the per-key reading and gets `None` where the answer
//! is a number, or a number where the answer is zero.
//!
//! **The horizon itself is still absent, and the premise that makes projecting
//! without it safe is untouched.** What the bound buys is stated in D-121's own
//! words: "a delta is O(live keys x windows within `H`), never O(the plan's
//! accumulated history)". A plan's accumulated history is its `superseded` price
//! rows — and `published -> superseded` has exactly two sanctioned producers, the
//! D-88 supersession unit and the D-100 cutover. **The premise here has narrowed and
//! this paragraph had not noticed** (found by review, 2026-08-05): as of that date the
//! flip has a producer in this crate — `price_repo::supersede_row`, inside
//! `commit_supersession_rows` — so what holds the premise is no longer "nothing
//! produces it" but the strictly weaker **"no surface reaches it"**: the orchestrator,
//! the approval unit and the route do not exist, so nothing a client can call flips a
//! published row. [`crate::infra::publish`] states its own version of this at the same
//! strength and names the group that deletes it. So the set D-121 filters is still
//! exactly the plan's `published` rows, capped at 500 by §14 — and the window set
//! beside them is the live keys' own rather than an accumulation, because a key's
//! history is made of `superseded` rows that no *mounted* path yet produces.
//!
//! **The group that builds the supersession unit or the cutover deletes that
//! premise and owes the horizon** — and, with it, `H`'s own input, "the longest
//! billing cycle sold on the plan", which is W6's term under a third margin. Whether
//! it exists by then depends on G3 having landed it; nothing in this tree produces it
//! today, and this paragraph does not promise that anything will. This is where they
//! will find out that they owe it.
//!
//! The cost of projecting anyway is still real, and it is smaller by one fact than
//! it was: the per-fact list in [`crate::domain::projection`] now records the
//! window facts as **present**, and predicate (5)'s GA-gate flags and predicate
//! (6)'s registry `sellable` flag as the two that remain absent — so a version
//! this projector writes answers four of six rather than three. What makes the
//! remainder bearable rather than reckless is unchanged: **nothing reads a delta
//! payload today and nothing can** — `bss_pricing_sdk::api` says resolution
//! "arrives with the slices that own those payloads", there is no resolution
//! route, no in-process resolve method and no consumer gear here.
//!
//! ## 2. D-136's advance strands a version that completes out of order
//!
//! Read literally, the frontier advances only in the transaction completing
//! "the frontier's **next** version in order". §4.4's own D-114 worked example
//! is `V5` degraded and `V6` fully warm: when `V5` finally completes the
//! frontier moves to `V5` — and `V6`, already complete, will never see another
//! completion to advance on. The frontier would stand at `V5` forever with a
//! complete `V6` behind it.
//!
//! So [`advance_frontier`] **walks forward** after an advance, moving the
//! watermark through every immediately-following version that is already fully
//! warm. That is strictly within "only ever forward" and "never past a gap" —
//! what it is not is the literal sentence. **Reported.**
//!
//! ## 3. §4.4's "current revision" is the wrong source, and the ref row carries
//! what is right
//!
//! If revision 3 publishes into `V5` and revision 4 publishes into `V6` before
//! `V5` warms, projecting `V5` from the plan's *current* revision freezes
//! revision 4's content into `V5`'s delta. §4.4 defends the re-drive against
//! **draft** leakage and says nothing at all about a later **published**
//! revision — and the window is up to D-47's five-minute batching maximum
//! rather than the 5s warm SLO, so this is reachable rather than theoretical.
//! Permanently, too: a delta is INSERT-only on the seven-year horizon, in a
//! store whose contract is that a completed version never changes.
//!
//! So the commit pins **the revision it judged and the lifecycle state that
//! judgement produced** on the ref row, and the projector reads those. An
//! earlier version of this paragraph argued the opposite — that putting the
//! revision on the ref row "contradicts D-86/D-91's subject typing and invents
//! a column" — and that was wrong rather than merely outweighed: D-86/D-91 key
//! `pricing_read_model`, which is untouched, and a revision is a property of
//! the **publish unit**, exactly as D-157's subject columns are.
//!
//! D-128's substance is untouched and is what makes a pinned revision safe:
//! `(plan_id, revision)` is the same row whether it stands `published` or
//! `retired`, and retirement opens no revision — it is a publish unit of its
//! own, which pins that same number with its own state and its own version.
//! That is also why the **state** is pinned and not read live: read live it
//! admits `superseded`, a third value D-128 does not contemplate for a
//! projected subject and that `load_current` could never return, which a
//! consumer coding sellability predicate (4) as "is published" reads as
//! unsellable.
//!
//! **Both columns are reported as divergences.** §3.7 lists neither, and
//! §4.4's current-revision rule is what they contradict.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! **No audit row.** No document requires one for a projection, and
//! `pricing_audit_log` is the actor/before-after trail of a **mutation**
//! (`inst-au-complete`): a projection has no actor and changes no truth. The
//! absence is stated so it is not read as an oversight.
//!
//! **No producer for `DomainError::ReadModelUnavailable`.** It is the **read**
//! path's fail-closed answer, and the read path does not exist.
//!
//! **No wire code for anything refused here.** The projector has no caller a
//! client can reach — it is driven by a background sweep — so a refusal has
//! nobody to report to, which is D-146's own line about the pin frontier.
