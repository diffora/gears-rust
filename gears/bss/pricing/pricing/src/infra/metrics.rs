//! `OpenTelemetry` adapter implementing [`PricingMetricsPort`].
//!
//! Instruments are pulled from the process-global meter provider the host
//! installs; until an exporter is wired they are no-ops, so emitting is always
//! cheap and can never be the reason a publish fails.
//!
//! # Names are literal Prometheus names, suffixes baked in
//!
//! The platform's collector runs `add_metric_suffixes: false`, so the exporter
//! renders instrument names **verbatim**. Counters therefore end `_total` and
//! duration histograms `_seconds` in the name itself, and nothing calls
//! `.with_unit()` — a unit set there would be silently dropped rather than
//! appended. Gauges carry a unit in the name when they have one and stay bare
//! when they are a count. This is the sibling ledger's posture, and RBAC / RMS /
//! openbao's before it; the value of matching it exactly is that one scrape
//! config and one naming convention cover the estate.
//!
//! The names below are transcribed from `design/04-currency-tax.md` §10 rather
//! than derived from the method names, for the reason every code constant in
//! this crate is: a name that drifted from its declaration would still compile
//! and would still be wrong on the wire.
