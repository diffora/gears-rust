//! The grandfathering cutover's commit, across both planes (`inst-gc-commit`, D-100).
//!
//! `infra::supersession`'s shape with one more window and one more row, and the two
//! ordering constraints it records hold here for the same reasons and through the
//! same two mechanisms. What this unit adds is a **second arrival**: the
//! grandfathered copy, on a new generation of the predecessor's key, born in the
//! same transaction as the successor that replaces it.
//!
//! # What this door owes the rows it publishes (D-344)
//!
//! It copied `supersede_in`'s *shape* and not its *rule sets*, and for as long as
//! that stood a cutover's entirely client-authored successor reached `published`
//! judged by two window checks and two store-level content checks — no
//! `price_row_rules`, no `supersession_rules`, no plan aggregate, no fixture gate.
//! D-344 settled which rules a door owes by the **act** it performs rather than by
//! which door it is, and all three tiers land here:
//!
//! * **Tier A**, at steps 2 and 7 — [`plan_supersession`] over the predecessor and
//!   the successor as the store will hold it, exactly where `supersede_in` spends
//!   it. A cutover supersedes on the predecessor's own canonical scope key
//!   (`inst-co-supersede`), so the tier counter continues across the act and
//!   `SupersessionUnitGuard` binds it for the same reason it binds a supersession.
//! * **Tier B**, at step 8b — [`run_publish_rules`] over the plan as this act's two
//!   drafts leave it. A cutover mints a **generation**, and `priceEligibility` is a
//!   scope-key axis, so this act changes which keys are current; a same-key
//!   supersession does not, which is why `supersede_in` does not run it.
//! * **The fixture gate**, beside Tier B, because a cutover's content is authored
//!   rather than derived.

/// there is a stated consequence rather than an omission.
///
/// # Why it runs after the writes and not before them
///
/// **Measured, not preferred.** `run_publish_rules` asserts things about *which rows
/// are current on which key*, and between `stage_both` and `commit_cutover` this plan
/// carries two rows on one key: the published predecessor and the draft successor
/// that will replace it. Asked there, `inst-cmp-injective` reports the pair as a
/// duplicate `(meter, dimensionKey)` line — correctly, on the shape it was handed —
/// and every cutover of a usage key is refused for a duplication the act itself is
/// halfway through removing. `inst-wc-required` is the same shape from the other side:
/// the grandfathered copy stands on a generation key nothing has covered until
/// `commit_cutover` schedules its window.
///
/// After the writes both dissolve without a flag or an exception:
/// [`CANDIDATE_ROW_STATES`](crate::infra::publish::CANDIDATE_ROW_STATES) excludes
/// `superseded`, so the predecessor has left the row set, and both new keys carry the
/// windows this act just wrote. That is the same placement and the same reason as
/// `infra::repricing::commit_plan_aggregate_in`, which runs the identical pass over
/// the plan "as this transaction just left it".
