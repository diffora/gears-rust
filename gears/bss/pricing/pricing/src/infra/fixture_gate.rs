//! The joint-conformance publish gate (`inst-fx-gate`).
//!
//! Publish of a catalog row is admissible only while a **green** joint fixture
//! pins what that row means on the pricing <-> Rating seam. The corpus lives in
//! `gears/bss/fixtures`; its generated `registry.toml` is the artifact this gate
//! reads, because the gate runs inside a publish transaction and cannot run an
//! oracle there.
//!
//! ## The gate is asked about a row, not about a kind
//!
//! A row needs **every fixture its shape requires**, and the design set names
//! four of them as registry *variants* (S3 design 6: the registry is keyed
//! `model_kind` / `variant`):
//!
//! | The row is ... | and it additionally needs |
//! |---|---|
//! | anything | its `modelKind` variant (`inst-fx-gate`, `inst-fx-kinds`) |
//! | non-`sum` | the `level_aggregation` variant (`inst-la-fixture`, D-44) |
//! | a tiered **usage** kind | the `supersession_continuity` variant (D-22) |
//! | reserved | the `reserved` variant (`inst-fx-kinds`, Slice 10) |
//!
//! Asked about a bare `modelKind` the last three say nothing: a `peak` row would
//! publish on the strength of a `sum` row's fixture, and the level-aggregation,
//! supersession-continuity and reservation variants would gate nothing at all.
//! [`required_variants`] is where a row's variant set is decided, and it is the
//! whole content of that fix.
//!
//! The gear takes `bss-fixtures` with `default-features = false`. That surface
//! is `ModelKind` + `Variant` + `Registry` + `Registry::gate_open_for`, and the
//! question it answers per variant is deliberately `oracle && publish`: the
//! reference oracle stands in for Tariffs until Tariffs exists, and requiring
//! the `rating` half as well would block every publish at launch. An
//! unregistered `(kind, variant)` pair is never open.
//!
//! ## This is not `pricing_conformance_fixture_registry`
//!
//! S3 design 6 also specifies a **gear-side table**,
//! `pricing_conformance_fixture_registry` (`model_kind` / `variant`,
//! `fixture_ref`, `status`), tenant-global and read-only to every API path,
//! populated by the `FixtureRegistrySync` background task. That table is Slice
//! 3's and **does not exist yet**; nothing here builds it, and `fixture_ref` /
//! `status` appear nowhere in this gear.
//!
//! The two must not blur together. The corpus registry read here is a property
//! of the *gear build*: it ships in the artifact, it is regenerated from the
//! case files, and it carries no `fixture_ref` because the fixture it points at
//! is the corpus itself. When the table lands, this gate reads the table and the
//! generated file becomes what `FixtureRegistrySync` reconciles it *against* —
//! the variant vocabulary below is the same one, which is what will let the
//! swap be a swap rather than a second reading.
//!
//! **Fail-closed, in both directions.** There is no configuration value that
//! opens this gate, and a registry that cannot be read produces a *closed*
//! gate rather than a boot failure or a permissive default. The split is
//! deliberate: the read path this gear serves to Rating and Tariffs must keep
//! working when the fixtures artifact is missing from a deployment, while every
//! publish of every row then fails with `FIXTURE_MISSING`. A gate that cannot
//! read its registry has no basis on which to answer "green", and the only safe
//! answer it has left is "no".

/// - [`Variant::LevelAggregation`] on a non-`sum` row — `inst-la-fixture`:
///   "publish of any non-`sum` row without the green joint fixture is blocked
///   (`FIXTURE_MISSING`), exactly like a `modelKind` variant". Read off
///   [`PriceRow::is_level`], which resolves the `sum` default, so an unauthored
///   `aggregationFunction` and an authored `sum` are one row here as everywhere.
/// - [`Variant::SupersessionContinuity`] on a **tiered usage** row — D-22, which
///   ratified the continuity fixture as gating "the first publish of any tiered
///   usage kind (alongside that kind's own fixture)". Both halves are required:
///   tieredness because the fixture is about a tier counter, and `is_usage`
///   because a non-usage row has no counter to continue. Tieredness is read off
///   the **presented** kind
///   ([`is_presented_tiered`](crate::domain::allowance::is_presented_tiered)),
///   which differs from [`PriceRow::is_tiered`] on exactly one shape: an
///   untiered `per_unit` row carrying an `includedAllowance`, which publishes as
///   a band ladder (`inst-ac-band`).
/// - [`Variant::Reserved`] on a reserved row — `inst-rv-fixture`: "the
///   reservation variant requires its own joint golden fixture before publish
///   (registered into Slice 3's `FixtureGate`)". **This clause is that
///   registration**, and it is the half of `inst-rv-fixture` this gear owns; the
