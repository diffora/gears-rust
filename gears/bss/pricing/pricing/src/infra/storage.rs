//! Persistence layer for the catalog Foundation: the migration chain, the
//! `SeaORM` entities over its tables, and the repositories that read them.
//!
//! Everything here is infrastructure by construction (DE0301): the domain layer
//! never learns that a `Plan` is a row. Where a repository hands back a value
//! the rest of the system reasons about, it maps at this boundary — see
//! [`repo::PinFrontierRepo`], which reads a `pricing_pin_frontier` row and
//! returns the SDK's `PinFrontier`.
//!
//! Every physical table carries the gear-name prefix `pricing_`
//! (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7) and lives in schema `bss` on Postgres.
//! `SQLite` is the fast non-production test backend: it mirrors the shape
//! (`uuid` -> `text`, `timestamptz` -> `text`, `jsonb` -> `text`) and, unlike
//! the sibling ledger's substrate, it also mirrors the **append-only guards** —
//! `RAISE(ABORT,...)` triggers stand in for PL/pgSQL `RAISE EXCEPTION`, so the
//! column whitelists are exercised by the fast test suite rather than only by
//! the Docker-gated Postgres one.

/// shared predicate beats "a substring this crate invented" — and the residue it
/// names is exactly this: *"the class says a unique index refused and not **which**
/// … the driver exposes the constraint identity only inside a message"*. Three
/// things make this the narrow case rather than a precedent:
///
/// * **the literals are DDL this chain owns**, not vendor phrasing. `sea_orm` has no
///   structured constraint identity — `SqlErr::UniqueConstraintViolation` carries a
///   `String` — so the alternatives were an `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on the primary
///   key of a table whose whole discipline is that nothing is silently swallowed, or
///   a read-then-write pre-check for the *other* index, which is the shape D-192 is
///   about removing;
/// * **the fallback is today's behaviour.** An unrecognised message is
///   [`contention_or_db`], so a driver or proxy that renders violations differently
///   degrades to "retry" — safe, because a retry then meets the in-transaction check
///   — and never to a 500;
/// * **it is asserted on the mirror**, by
///   `tests/sqlite_approval_repo.rs::a_second_open_policy_proposal_is_refused_by_the_mint_guard_and_not_as_contention`
///   and its primary-key twin, so a rename of the index that forgot this function
///   reddens. The Postgres half of the predicate rests on the index name reaching the
///   message, which is that server's documented rendering and what
///   `postgres_migrations.rs`'s partial-index census keeps true of the name.
///
/// **The residue runs the other way and is worth naming.** An unrecognised message
/// degrades safely, but a *recognised* one can be wrong: a future second unique index on
/// `pricing_approval` whose key involves `tenant_id` would render the same substring on
/// the `SQLite` mirror and be reported as this guard — a specific wrong answer rather
/// than a generic retry, which is the one direction the fallback does not cover. What
/// keeps it visible is the index census in `tests/sqlite_migrations.rs` and
/// `tests/postgres_migrations.rs`: a second index on this table cannot be added without
/// appearing there, so the reader adding it meets this function's name in the same diff.
/// If one is ever added, narrow the `SQLite` arm to the index name the way the Postgres
/// arm already is.

/// [`RepoError::ValueOutOfRange`] is the one arm left on

/// [`RepoError::StaleRowVersion`] is rendered into
