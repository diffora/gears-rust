//! The two pieces of the history read that are decidable without a database.
//!
//! Everything else this module claims — the commit order, the walk that resumes
//! where the last page stopped, the actor the projection reports and the
//! intervals it attaches — is a statement about rows in two tables, and is
//! proved in `tests/sqlite_history.rs` against a real one. A page assembled from
//! a vector this file built would certify that the assembly compiles, which is
//! not what any of those claims say.
//!
//! What is worth isolating is the **token**, because it is the whole of
//! "opaque": a cursor that survives a round trip is the only thing standing
//! between D-125's contract and a client that reconstructs the walk's position
//! from a value it can read. The sub-second instant is the load-bearing part of
//! the case — a token that carried milliseconds would round-trip every whole
//! second perfectly and would silently re-serve the cursor's own row for every
//! instant finer than one.
