//! The SINGLE authoritative `DomainError` → AIP-193 `CanonicalError` ladder.
//!
//! Both surfaces consume it: REST handlers via `?` / an explicit map, and the
//! in-process client via `.map_err(CanonicalError::from)`. A domain variant is
//! therefore assigned a canonical category — and an HTTP status — in exactly
//! one place, which is what keeps the wire contract the design set states from
//! drifting per handler.
//!
//! The wire codes are the names the design set uses verbatim
//! (`DUPLICATE_SCOPE_KEY`, `STALE_VERSION`, `IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH`,
//! `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_IN_FLIGHT`, `OPEN_DRAFT_REVISION_EXISTS`,
//! `ROUNDING_POLICY_UNRESOLVED`, `PRECISION_EXCEEDED`,
//! `TIMESTAMP_PRECISION_EXCEEDED`, `AMOUNT_NEGATIVE`, `CURRENCY_INVALID`,
//! `FIXTURE_MISSING`, `PLAN_RETIRED_NO_SUCCESSOR`,
//! `GRANDFATHER_UNTIL_FORBIDDEN`, `CONCURRENT_MUTATION`, the five
//! `05-governance.md` §5 declares — `APPROVAL_NOT_PENDING`,
//! `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH`, `SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN`,
//! `REGION_SCOPE_DENIED`, `REASON_REQUIRED` — and
//! `PENDING_CHANGE_UNIT_EXISTS`, which `07-pricewindow-linkage.md` §5 declares
//! and this gear's submit path is the first writer of); a consumer matches the
//! category coarsely and the code **exactly**.
//!
//! # Why a registry refusal is a 400 and a registry outage is a 503
//!
//! `CatalogVersionRegistryError` has four variants and until 2026-08-13 all four
//! reached this ladder as one `CatalogVersionUnavailable`, rendering a bare 503
//! with no code and no discriminator. Three of them deserve that: `Unconfigured`,
//! `Unreachable` and `Internal` are deployment states, and a later request may
//! find them changed. `Rejected` — an unknown SKU, a closed version — is the
//! registry having **answered**, and it will answer the same way for as long as
//! the request is made unchanged.
//!
//! A status code is a retry instruction, so the collapse was not merely a lost
//! diagnostic: it told every client to retry a decision that never moves, and a
//! client that honours it retries forever. `Rejected` therefore lands on
//! `CatalogVersionRejected` and this ladder's failed-precondition family — the
//! 400 the paragraph below calls architectural, carrying
//! `CATALOG_VERSION_REJECTED` as the discriminator — while the other three keep
//! the 503. The classification rule is the family's own: a rejection is
//! classified by **what it is**, and this one is a precondition on the plan's
//! content that the author has to change. `crate::domain::ports::registry_failure`
//! is the single place the split is made and carries the withdrawn argument.
//!
//! **Two codes below are *not* names the design set uses**, and they are called
//! out here rather than left to be assumed.
//!
//! `WITHDRAW_FORBIDDEN` is minted by this crate. §5 declares no code for a
//! withdraw refused on the withdrawer's identity, because the design set does not
//! contemplate the refusal existing — `inst-as-void` states the identity rule
//! while the endpoint map gates the route on `approval × approve`, and nothing
//! reconciles the two. See `domain::approval::decision::WithdrawAuthority`.
//!
//! `CATALOG_VERSION_REJECTED` is minted for the same kind of reason one plane
//! over: D-47 fixes the registry as the sole incrementer and the contract names
//! four failures, but the design set declares a code for none of them because it
//! treats every one of them as the same fail-closed publish. It is not — see the
//! section above — and a 400 has to carry a code or it discriminates nothing.
//!
//! *Exactly* is why the three 403 arms carry a **bare code** in `reason` and drop
//! their detail. `permission_denied()` has no detail slot — its detail is the
//! fixed platform sentence and `reason` is the only free field — so a detail
//! carried there would have to ride the code as `"CODE: detail"`, and a consumer
//! comparing `reason` to `SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN` would never match. What is
//! given up is nothing the caller lacks and nothing an operator loses: the
//! detail names the approval record, which is the id the caller addressed the
//! request to, and the attempt itself is already on `pricing_audit_log` as a
//! `deny` record carrying that id (`inst-tp-selfaudit`, `inst-rb-audit`) —
//! a durable trail rather than a log line.
//!
//! **That clause names a compensating control, so the control has to exist**, and
//! for two waves it did not: the table had a writer and no reader on any mounted
//! surface, which makes "recoverable from the trail" an argument about a place
//! nobody can look (Z13-8). `GET /bss-pricing/v1/audit`
//! ([`crate::api::rest::audit`]) is that reader — Auditor-only, and the `deny`
//! record's `approval_ref` is the dropped id. Two qualifications, because the
//! sentence above is stronger than what is built. The trail is behind
//! `audit × read`, so the principal who *met* the 403 is generally not the
//! principal who can read the record: what is preserved is the **operator's**
//! recourse, not the caller's, which is `inst-au-pii`'s and D-12's arrangement
//! rather than a shortfall. And of the two instructions cited, only
//! `inst-tp-selfaudit` has a writer on an HTTP path —
//! `REGION_SCOPE_DENIED` is unreachable over HTTP by construction
//! ([`crate::api::rest::approvals`] says why), so for that arm the clause is moot
//! rather than satisfied.
//!
//! **The design set's 422s are architectural, not wire** (normative:
//! `design/01-foundation.md` §3.3). They say *unprocessable content*; the
//! platform's canonical family has no 422 category at all —
//! `FailedPrecondition`, `InvalidArgument` and `OutOfRange` all render **400**
//! (`toolkit_canonical_errors::CanonicalError::status_code`) — so each reaches
//! the wire as a 400 carrying its code, and the **code is the discriminator**,
//! not the status. Two rules follow and are honoured below: a rejection is
//! classified by what it is, so a retriable conflict on mutable state stays a
//! **409** rather than collapsing into the 400 bucket; and no route may declare
//! a 422 in its `OpenAPI` registration, because no path can produce one.
