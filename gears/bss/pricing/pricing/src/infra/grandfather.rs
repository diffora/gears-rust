//! `PATCH /bss-pricing/v1/prices/{priceId}/grandfather-until` — the horizon door
//! (`inst-gs-bound`, `inst-gs-tighten`, S7 §5).
//!
//! The authoring surface for the grandfathered-row eligibility machine's two
//! stored transitions. Until it landed, S7 §4's machine had **no producer at all**:
//! the route was declared and unmounted, and no repository wrote
//! `grandfather_until` on a published row — a cutover *inserts* the generation
//! carrying whatever horizon it was composed with, `update_draft` swaps on
//! `lifecycle_state = 'draft'`, and `insert_successor_draft_on` refuses the
//! grandfathered class outright. So `active_indefinite → active_bounded` and
//! `active_bounded → active_bounded` were states a row could be *born* in and
//! never move between.
//!
//! `infra::window::mutate_in`'s shape, step for step, because a horizon tightening
//! is the same kind of act as a window mutation — an operator move on published
//! content, always material, one publish unit, one transaction. What differs is
//! listed here and nowhere else.
//!
//! # It moves the operand D-04 protects, so it asks D-04's own question
//!
//! `refuse_horizon_uncovered` asks `[max(cohort, now), grandfatherUntil + W6's
//! margin)` of every act `mutate_in` performs (D-316 clause (1)). This door writes
//! the **right-hand end of that span**, which no window act does — so asking the
//! rule against the stored horizon would judge the state this act is about to
//! discard. It is asked against the **proposed** horizon instead, over the key's
//! unmoved interval set:
//! [`refuse_horizon_span_uncovered`](crate::infra::window::refuse_horizon_span_uncovered).
//!
//! **Most of what this door does could not break the bound, and one thing can.**
//! Tightening a finite horizon moves the far end of the span *inwards*: the floor
//! `horizon + margin` falls, the walk has less to cover, and coverage that
//! satisfied the bound still satisfies it. The exception is `inst-gs-bound`.
//! A null horizon is judged by an arm that never consults the margin at all — it
//! asks only for an unbroken run into an open interval — while every finite horizon
//! is judged by an arm that **requires** the margin to have a value. So a
//! generation on a market where the plan sells recurring and authors no frequency
//! passes indefinitely and is refused the moment a bound is set. That is the one
//! shape where this act can newly break D-04, it is the reason the guard is called
//! rather than argued away, and `a_generation_whose_plan_has_no_margin_may_not_be_bounded`
//! is armed against exactly it.
//!
//! Calling it rather than reasoning about it is also the standing lesson of D-316's
//! own residual, which records four write paths that reach the window plane around
//! `refuse_horizon_uncovered` and are held shut *"by an argument rather than by a
//! structure"* — and names the day one of those arguments stops holding as the day
//! the defect arrives. A fifth path is not something to add to that list.
//!
//! # It records a before-image, which is D-327's lesson taken rather than repeated
//!
//! D-327 recorded that D-05's cutover unwind could not restore a shortened
//! `effectiveTo` because **no before-image was recorded** anywhere: the cutover
//! reaches `window_repo::adjust_effective_to` directly, that is an in-place `UPDATE`
//! of a table with no before-image column, and the operand the unwind needs
//! therefore did not exist. A horizon tightening is an in-place `UPDATE` of the
//! same kind, so it would have been the next instance of that defect.
//!
//! **The cutover's own instance is repaired**, by this section's
//! remedy applied where D-327 found the defect: `infra::cutover::record_cutover` and
//! `infra::supersession`'s step 11 now carry the shortened window's interval as a
//! value, and `audit_repo::for_subject` reads it back. So the account below is a
//! description of a shared arrangement rather than of an exception this module
//! makes.
//!
//! It is not, because the audit record carries `before_state` and `after_state` —
//! `infra::window::mutate_in`'s arrangement, which pays the same debt for the
//! window plane through `pricing_audit_log` rather than through a column no
//! decision names. The prior horizon is therefore recoverable from the trail by
//! anything that ever needs to reverse one of these acts. What this crate does
//! **not** do is offer a reversal: `active_bounded` has no edge back to
//! `active_indefinite` and a later horizon is `GRANDFATHER_LOOSEN_FORBIDDEN`, so
//! the before-image is evidence rather than an undo. That is still a deliberate
//! difference from the cutover's case, where the unwind is a *decided* clause —
//! it now has its operand and waits on `unwound`, D-333's approval state, whose
//! store column is not built.
//!
//! # No event, and no code minted
//!
//! S7 §4's transition list declares no event for either edge, and `inst-el-expiry`
//! says in as many words that the expiry side needs *"no job, no new event (§7
//! holds)"*. The one event that superficially fits — `PriceUpdated` — is the
//! **supersession's**, deduplicated on the successor's id alone under the argument
//! that *"a row is superseded-onto exactly once"*, so a second tightening of one
//! row would collapse into the first. Minting a token for this act would be this
//! crate declaring a wire fact the design set does not, which D-204 clause (2)
//! refuses. Consumers therefore see the new horizon exactly as D-06 has them see an
//! overlay or a membership: at `CatalogVersionPublished` plus warm, through the
//! publish unit this act records — and `domain::projection` does carry
//! `grandfatherUntil`, which is what makes the publish unit necessary rather than
//! ceremonial.
//!
//! The two refusals of this door's own — `GRANDFATHER_LOOSEN_FORBIDDEN` and
//! `GRANDFATHER_UNTIL_FORBIDDEN` — are both **declared** by S7 §5. The third code
//! §5 declares for this surface, `GRANDFATHERED_ROW_IMMUTABLE`, has no producer
//! here and is reported rather than co-opted: §5 glosses none of the three, and
//! Foundation §4.3's sentence that a grandfathered generation *"is immutable in
//! price and may not be superseded; only its grandfatherUntil may be tightened"*
//! puts that code on the acts this door refuses to be — which is
//! `price_repo::refuse_unsupersedable_class`'s ground, and that refusal already
//! carries `LIFECYCLE_FORBIDDEN`.
