//! The supersession unit's commit, across both planes (`inst-su-commit`, D-88).
//!
//! [`crate::domain::supersession`] decides — the changeover's two floors, the two
//! window operations, and whether the successor's content may land on a continued
//! counter. This module *writes* what that decided, and it exists for one property
//! neither the row repository nor the window repository can hold on its own:
//! **four writes on two planes, in one transaction, in one order**.
//!
//! # The order is the whole of it, and it is two constraints rather than one
//!
//! `inst-su-commit` says "or everything rolls back" and D-195 makes the *row* order
//! normative. Building it turned up a second ordering constraint of the same shape on
//! the window plane, enforced by a different mechanism:
//!
//! 1. **The predecessor's window is shortened before the successor's is scheduled.**
//!    `window_repo::schedule` refuses an interval intersecting one already on the key,
//!    so an open-ended successor scheduled while the predecessor's window is still
//!    open-ended is `WINDOW_OVERLAP` — the refusal `inst-su-compose` promises a
//!    committed unit can never produce, arriving from the store instead.
//! 2. **The predecessor's row leaves the published plane before the successor's
//!    arrives** ([`price_repo::commit_supersession_rows`], D-195): §3.7 admits one
//!    published row per key, and the wrong order is a raw driver error rather than a
//!    refusal.
//!
//! Two constraints, two mechanisms, one function — so no caller is in a position to
//! satisfy one and miss the other. That is the same argument
//! `commit_supersession_rows` makes about its own pair, applied one level up, and it
//! is why this composition is not a convenience.
//!
//! # Rows before windows, and a probe is what decided it
//!
//! The order **between** the two pairs is free for correctness: `window_repo` resolves a
//! window's canonical scope key through `pricing_price` without regard to the row's
//! `lifecycle_state` (verified against every predicate it applies, not from its docs), so
//! a `superseded` predecessor changes nothing either window write sees. What the order
//! decides is **what the loser of a race is told**, and that is measurable.
//!
//! Writing the windows first — on the ground that their preconditions are the volatile
//! ones while the row's is "a frozen version that only this unit's own siblings move" —
//! rests on a false premise: the presented version is the *successor draft's*, and
//! `PriceRepo::update_draft` bumps it on every mounted `PATCH …/prices/{priceId}`.
//! D-141 freezes *published* rows.
//!
//! With the reason gone, `tests/postgres_supersession_race.rs` was written to measure the
//! difference, and it is not cosmetic. Two commits of one unit — a retry after a timeout,
//! a double approval — serialize on whichever plane is written first:
//!
//! - **windows first**: the loser blocks on the predecessor window's row, finds
//!   `mutation_seq` moved, and is answered [`RepoError::StaleRowVersion`] — which sends an
//!   operator to re-read a **window entity tag** that is not what changed.
//! - **rows first**: the loser blocks on the predecessor *price row*, finds it
//!   `superseded`, and is answered [`RepoError::NotSupersedable`] — whose message names the
//!   actionable remedy, *recompose against the key's new current row*.
//!
//! The probe is the evidence: reordering the pairs flips the refusal, with the same
//! choreography and the same winner. So rows go first, and the argument recorded here is
//! **diagnosis** rather than correctness — which is also why it can be stated plainly
//! instead of defended.
//!
//! The orchestrator does not make this moot, and an earlier note claiming it would was
//! wrong: re-running `plan_supersession` at commit checks the instant, the plane and the
//! content, and **not** whether the predecessor is still its key's current row —
//! `plan_supersession` takes two `PriceRow`s and a window plane, neither of which carries
//! a lifecycle state.
//!
//! It is also a **lock order**, and on Postgres a lock order must be consistent across
//! writers or two transactions deadlock. Nothing violates it: `infra::window`'s mutation
//! unit only *reads* `pricing_price` and writes only `pricing_price_window`, and
//! `publish_rows` touches only price rows, so no writer takes the two in the opposite
//! order. "Free" is about correctness, never a licence to reverse this elsewhere.
//!
//! # What [`commit_supersession`] does **not** do
//!
//! It requests no `CatalogVersion`, enqueues no event, writes no approval record and
//! no audit entry. `inst-su-commit` names all of those, and they belong to the layer
//! that owns the unit — [`SupersessionService`], below — the same division
//! `price_repo::publish_rows` keeps against `PublishService::commit`, whose step 6
//! writes one record for the whole act rather than one per row moved. What
//! [`commit_supersession`] is, is the part that has to be one transaction whatever the
//! layer above decides, and it stays a separate function for that reason rather than
//! being inlined into the orchestrator now that both live here.
//!
//! # The orchestrator is in this file, and the whole act is one transaction
//!
//! [`SupersessionService::supersede`] is `inst-su-compose`'s composer and
//! `inst-su-commit`'s owner at once. Its order is the load-bearing part and it is
//! documented at [`supersede_in`]; the short version is that the successor draft is part
//! of the plan shape the unit's content pin covers, so it has to be staged **before** the
//! unit is opened or the pin is taken over a world without the row under review.

///
/// Concretely: a shorten to `T1` with a schedule from `T2 > T1` leaves `[T1, T2)`
/// uncovered. Nothing in the transaction notices, because window collision is an
/// **intersection** test (`window_repo`'s `intersects`) and a gap is not an
