//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_region_taxonomy` — the region value universe
//! (`design/04-currency-tax.md` §6, D-01).
//!
//! **Slice 4's table**, carried on the Slice 9 chain because `inst-plv-scope`
//! validates against it and it did not exist; `m20260802_000028`'s module doc
//! carries the whole argument.
//!
//! The one of the four that carries the `tax_*` pair, and §6 is explicit that it
//! is the only one: a tax category rides the price row's `tax_category_ref`
//! (D-110) or this table's default, and a third place for one to live is the
//! cardinality error D-110 removed from `pricing_plan_descriptor_set`.
