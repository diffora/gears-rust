//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_bundle` — a bundle's identity, its price
//! basis and its invoice itemization (`design/08-bundles.md` §6, D-105).
//!
//! Keyed `bundle_id` alone. The composition itself does **not** live here: it
//! lives in the three revision-scoped child tables, which is what lets a draft
//! recomposition edit its own copies (D-92). What is here is what a bundle *is*
//! rather than what it *contains* — plus, for now, two columns that are content
//! and are not revision-scoped; `m20260802_000024`'s module doc carries that
//! hazard and it is in the owed register.
//!
//! `plan_id` is the join D-92's *"a bundle rides its plan's revisions"* needs,
//! and it carries no database foreign key — `pricing_plan` is keyed
//! `(plan_id, revision)` and has only partial uniqueness on `plan_id`, which
//! Postgres refuses as a referent. The child tables enforce the reference
//! transitively through their own append-only triggers.
