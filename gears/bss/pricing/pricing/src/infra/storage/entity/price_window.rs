//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_price_window` — one half-open interval a
//! price row is effective over (`design/07-pricewindow-linkage.md` §6).
//!
//! `effective_to` is `Option` and the absence is a **value**: `NULL` is
//! open-ended, a window that never expires (`inst-ws-expire`), and not a bound
//! nobody got round to setting. Nothing here reconstructs it as "unknown".
//!
//! The three flip timestamps are nullable and their nullability is not
//! independent of `state`: the migration's three biconditional CHECKs make
//! `activated_at` present exactly on an `active` or `expired` window,
//! `expired_at` exactly on an `expired` one, and `cancelled_at` exactly on a
//! `cancelled` one. So `state` is the reading and
//! [`crate::domain::window::WindowState`] is what carries it —
//! `crate::infra::storage::repo::window_repo` reads the token through that
//! type's `ALL` slice rather than reconstructing a lifecycle from which columns
//! happen to be set, for the reason
//! [`super::approval`] gives one table over.
//!
//! **This entity carries no canonical scope key**, and no `plan_id` either. Both
//! live on `pricing_price`, and the window is bound to a row rather than to a
//! key precisely so the two cannot disagree; the repository resolves the key on
//! every read and hands back a `WindowRecord` that carries it, which is what the
//! non-overlap and coverage rules are per.
//!
//! The `resource_col` is `window_id`, so a scope naming one window reaches that
//! row and no other — `pricing_approval`'s shape.
