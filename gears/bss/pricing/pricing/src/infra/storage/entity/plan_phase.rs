//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_plan_phase` — one phase of **one plan
//! revision** (`design/02-plan-definition.md` §6), keyed
//! `(tenant_id, plan_id, plan_revision, phase_id)`.
//!
//! The tuple is not a composite id: `plan_revision` says *which copy* of the
//! phase this row is, and `phase_id` is the phase itself, stable for the life
//! of the plan. A new revision copies these rows under its own number without
//! re-minting an id (D-83), because the `phase` axis of the canonical scope key
//! holds a bare `phase_id` (D-19) and same-key supersession compares it (D-56).
//!
//! **`tenant_id` and `plan_id` joined the key under D-340
//! (`m20260802_000081`).** Without them the key said that one phase id belongs to
//! one plan per revision *number* across the whole table, every tenant's
//! included — so five drafts on the stand that shared an id had four members that
//! could never attach it, unrecoverably, a scope key being a price row's identity.
//! What the widening leaves standing is the half the phase-graph rules rely on: one
//! revision still may not hold the same phase id twice.
//!
//! The four attributes are in field order rather than in the physical key's order,
//! and that is not a divergence anything can observe: `SeaORM` names columns in
//! every statement it builds, and the one construct where key order is a signature
//! — `Entity::find_by_id`'s tuple — has no call site in this gear.
//!
//! There is no `lifecycle_state` here. A phase row is frozen when **its**
//! revision publishes, so the parent `pricing_plan` row is the referent and the
//! table's append-only triggers read it — the same arrangement
//! `pricing_price_tier_band` has with its price row.
