//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_price` — the price rows and, in the same
//! table, the price **history** (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7).
//!
//! **Eight** of the ten canonical scope-key columns come first and in normative
//! order (§4.1); the usage pair D-196 added — `meter` and `dimension_key` — sits
//! in the content block below, where the axes it also serves as content put it.
//! This is a claim about *this table's layout*, not about the axis count: the
//! 2026-08-09 stale-figure sweep changed it to "ten" and made it false (D-289). `cohort` is a `String` holding the domain token (`none`, or the
//! cutover instant) rather than an `Option<DateTime<Utc>>`, because it is a
//! column of a partial `UNIQUE` index and distinct `NULL`s do not collide.
//!
//! Money is integer minor units. `amount_minor` is nullable because its
//! placement is per-kind (Slice 3): required on `flat` / `per_unit`, and NULL on
//! the band and package kinds whose money lives elsewhere — so no row ever
//! carries two competing prices. "Elsewhere" is `package_price_minor` on this
//! very row for a `package`, and [`super::price_tier_band`] for
//! `graduated` / `volume`: the per-row Slice-3 columns sit here, and only the
//! band set, being many-per-row, needed a table.
//!
//! `included_allowance` is Slice-10-declared and rides along as opaque JSON.
//! This entity persists the authored declaration and compiles nothing from it.
//!
//! A published row's content is frozen — its only permitted UPDATEs are the
//! sanctioned `lifecycle_state` flip and a monotonic tightening of
//! `grandfather_until` — so `row_version` (the `ETag`) is frozen with it:
//! content that cannot change needs no new entity tag. The migration's module
//! doc records why the column exists at all, which Foundation §3.7 omits to say.
