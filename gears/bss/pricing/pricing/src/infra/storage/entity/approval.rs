//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_approval` — the approval workflow's record
//! (`design/05-governance.md` §6).
//!
//! Four columns are nullable and they are the same four the decision writes, so
//! their absence has one meaning between them: the record is still `submitted`.
//! The schema says it twice over — `chk_pricing_approval_decided_at` makes
//! `state = 'submitted'` and `decided_at IS NULL` the same fact, and
//! `chk_pricing_approval_approver` and `chk_pricing_approval_reason` bind the
//! other two to the outcome — which is why nothing here reconstructs pendingness
//! from a null. [`crate::domain::approval::ApprovalState`] is the reading, and
//! `state` is what carries it.
//!
//! `content_hash` is `Vec<u8>` rather than a hex `String`: it is a digest, the
//! column is `bytea` on Postgres and `blob` on `SQLite`, and a text rendering
//! would give one value two spellings for the comparison `inst-ap-pin` makes at
//! decision time.
//!
//! The `resource_col` is `approval_id`, so a scope naming one approval reaches
//! that row and no other — the same shape `pricing_policy_object` uses with its
//! tenant key.
