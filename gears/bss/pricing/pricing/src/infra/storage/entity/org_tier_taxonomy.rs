//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_org_tier_taxonomy` — the organisation-tier value universe D-120 added, `partner`'s sibling
//! (`design/04-currency-tax.md` §6).
//!
//! **Slice 4's table**, carried on the Slice 9 chain because `inst-plv-scope`
//! validates against it and it did not exist; `m20260802_000029`'s sibling
//! migrations carry the whole argument. It is the region taxonomy's shape minus
//! the two `tax_*` columns D-01 puts on that one alone.
//!
//! `resource_col` is the tenant, as on [`super::policy_object`]: a taxonomy is
//! per-tenant configuration and has no row-level resource id for a single-row
//! gate to pin.
