//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_bundle_revshare_group` — one rev-share group
//! per included vendor SKU within one bundle revision (`design/08-bundles.md`
//! §6, D-07 + D-55 + D-92 + D-105), keyed
//! `(bundle_id, plan_revision, vendor_sku_id)`.
//!
//! The group exists because D-07's tolerance and exact-sum rule is **per
//! `(bundle, vendor SKU)`**: *"sum to 100% per included vendor SKU"*. Before
//! D-55's correction the platform cut was a per-party column used once per group
//! (nothing stopped two parties disagreeing about one group's cut) and the
//! absorber was a bundle-level column typed as a `vendor_sku_id`, which names a
//! group and not a resolvable party.
