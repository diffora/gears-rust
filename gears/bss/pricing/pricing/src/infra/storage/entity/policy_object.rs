//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_policy_object` — the per-tenant policy
//! object (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7).
//!
//! Absence is meaningful on every nullable column here, and in each case it is
//! the fail-safe or ratified reading: no default rounding policy means every
//! published row must carry its own `rounding_policy_ref` or fail publish, and an
//! absent cap (D-152) means the ratified launch value from the deployment
//! section — so a tenant that configures nothing is governed by the numbers PRD
//! §14 ratified rather than by whatever a `NOT NULL DEFAULT` happened to say.
//!
//! **The approval threshold is not on this row.**
//! `approval_threshold_minor` / `approval_threshold_currency` are one currency's
//! absolute threshold; §6 requires per-currency `{absolute_minor | percent}`
//! entries and D-10 requires the policy to be versioned, neither of which a single
//! column pair can carry. `pricing_approval_threshold` moved the fact to
//! [`super::approval_threshold`] and dropped the pair in the same migration, so
//! there is exactly one place to read a threshold from.
//!
//! The four caps and the descriptor required-set extension sit here **for now**:
//! they are per-tenant settings with no settings gear to live in, and D-152's
//! confirmation records that they are expected to move once one exists.
//!
//! **Two content columns have a writer.** `tax_display_policy_mode` is set by
//! [`crate::infra::storage::repo::policy_repo::set_tax_display_policy`], behind the one
//! authoring surface the design set declares over this table (`PUT
//! /config/tax-display-policy`, S4 §5), and `default_rounding_policy_ref` by
//! [`crate::infra::storage::repo::policy_repo::set_default_rounding_policy`],
//! behind a compare-and-swap. The rest — `enforced_migration_notice_days`, the
//! caps and `additional_required_descriptors` — are read on live paths and
//! written by nothing in this crate, so every tenant holds the column default
//! and every read resolves to the fallback. That is deliberate rather than
//! pending: no document names a surface for them, and `policy_repo`'s module doc
//! carries the citations and the per-column consequence. Do not read a nullable
//! column here as "a tenant may configure this today".
