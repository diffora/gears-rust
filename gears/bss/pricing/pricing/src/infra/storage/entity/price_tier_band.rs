//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_price_tier_band` — the **authored** tier
//! bands of a `graduated` / `volume` price row
//! (`design/03-price-structure.md` §6).
//!
//! Authored bands only (D-130): the D-45 allowance compile is a projection into
//! the read model and never writes back here, so what this entity reads is
//! always what the operator wrote.
//!
//! Band quantities are **billable units** — the units that exist after
//! `billingGranularity` quantization (`inst-tb-units`), not raw metered ones.
//! The columns carry no unit of their own; the parent row's granularity is what
//! says what a `1` means.
//!
//! There is no ordinal column. A band's identity is its lower bound
//! (`UNIQUE (price_id, from_qty)`), which is why
//! `domain::rules::tier_bands::BandGeometry` judges a set sorted by `from_qty`
//! rather than in authored order: authored order does not survive this table.
