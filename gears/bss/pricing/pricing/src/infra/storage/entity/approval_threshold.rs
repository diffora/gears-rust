//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_approval_threshold` — one currency's
//! threshold entry in one version of a tenant's approval-threshold policy
//! (`design/05-governance.md` §6).
//!
//! Three columns are the key and every column is content, which is why the store
//! refuses both `DELETE` and `UPDATE`: a correction is a new `version`, because an
//! earlier version is what an approval's `content_hash` covers (D-10, and
//! `pricing_approval_threshold`'s migration doc has the argument).
//!
//! **There is no `state` column and that is deliberate.** Which version is the
//! tenant's policy is a fact about `pricing_approval` — the greatest version whose
//! unit an independent principal approved — and a column here would be a second
//! answer to it, free to disagree with the record that decided it.
//! [`crate::infra::threshold::effective_policy`] is the one reader of that fact.
//! (This line named `threshold_repo::effective_policy` until G6 wrote the function:
//! two docs spelled it two ways while neither module had it, and the repository was
//! the wrong of the two homes — it reads one store and the resolution reads both.)
//!
//! `percent_bp` is **basis points**, per `pricing_approval_threshold`'s recorded decision:
//! the design set declares no representation for §6's `percent > 0`, and basis
//! points is the set's own idiom (D-104's `share_bp`, `platform_cut_bp`). The unit
//! is in the column name so no reader has to infer it.
