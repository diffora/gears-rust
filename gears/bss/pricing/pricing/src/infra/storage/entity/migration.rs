//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_migration` — one scheduled plan migration
//! (`design/11-lifecycle.md` §6, `m20260802_000043`).
//!
//! The primary key is **client-supplied** (`inst-ms-api`, M2): a caller mints
//! `migration_id` and the store's uniqueness is what makes a timed-out retry
//! return the original schedule rather than create a second one. There is no
//! surrogate key and no dedup table beside this one.
//!
//! Absence is meaningful on all four nullable columns, and in each case it is a
//! statement about §4's reachable states rather than "not filled in yet":
//! `started_at`/`exclusion_snapshot` are co-nullable and absent exactly while the
//! run has not been declared started (D-65), and the two terminal instants are
//! biconditional with their states. The schema carries all of that; see the
//! migration's module doc for why `started_at` alone is written as two
//! implications instead.
