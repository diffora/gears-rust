//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_plan` — one **revision** of a plan
//! (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7, D-56), keyed `(plan_id, revision)`.
//!
//! At most one revision is the plan's **current** one (`published` or
//! `retired`, D-128) and at most one is an open `draft`; both are partial
//! `UNIQUE` indexes on the table, and a discarded draft's `abandoned` tombstone
//! is outside both, so a plan may hold any number of them (D-145). A published
//! revision's content is frozen — the only permitted UPDATE is the sanctioned
//! `lifecycle_state` flip — so `row_version` (the `ETag`) is frozen with it:
//! content that cannot change needs no new entity tag.
