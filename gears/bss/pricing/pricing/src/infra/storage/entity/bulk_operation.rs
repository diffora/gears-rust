//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_bulk_operation` — one bulk run and its
//! position in §4's state machine (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §6).
//!
//! Keyed on `operation_id` alone: a run is not revision-scoped and not part of
//! any plan's shape, so unlike `pricing_composite_meter` it owes no
//! copy-forward and no drop-on-abandon (D-256's obligation does not reach it).
//!
//! Only `state`, `report` and `completed_at` ever move; everything else is
//! frozen by the table's trigger, because a run's identity, kind and submitter
//! are what its report is *about* — `request_hash` among them since
//! `m20260802_000073`, the digest being what the replay compares an arriving body
//! against.
