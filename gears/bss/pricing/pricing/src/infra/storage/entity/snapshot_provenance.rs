//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_snapshot_provenance` — the frozen
//! `migrated-origin` record (`design/11-lifecycle.md` §6, `m20260802_000044`).
//!
//! Every column is written once and never again: the table's trigger refuses
//! `UPDATE` outright, because a `migrated-origin` ref resolves through no
//! `CatalogVersion` and this row is therefore the only thing that makes the
//! snapshot immutable.
//!
//! `source_revision` is the one nullable column that is not an absence: D-87
//! states that a tier-2 fully-legacy key may have **no plan revision at all**, so
//! `None` is a fact about where the row came from rather than something not yet
//! filled in.
