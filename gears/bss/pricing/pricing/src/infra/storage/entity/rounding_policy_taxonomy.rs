//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_rounding_policy_taxonomy` — the rounding
//! references a tenant declares (D-321).
//!
//! [`super::brand_taxonomy`]'s shape exactly, and its migration
//! (`m20260802_000080`) carries the argument for why the vocabulary is the
//! tenant's rather than this gear's: pricing persists a reference to a policy it
//! neither defines nor applies, so the only thing it can honestly refuse is a
//! reference to something nobody declared.
//!
//! It is **not** a fifth `TaxonomyClass`: that enum's token is the overlay
//! `scope_class` column, and an overlay cannot be scoped by rounding policy.
//!
//! `resource_col` is the tenant, as on [`super::policy_object`]: per-tenant
//! configuration has no row-level resource id for a single-row gate to pin.
