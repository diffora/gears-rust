//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_bulk_row_lock` — one price row held by an
//! in-flight bulk operation (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §6,
//! `inst-bk-lock`; Foundation `fr-concurrent-edit`).
//!
//! Keyed `(tenant_id, price_id)`, which **is** the mutual exclusion: two runs
//! cannot hold one row, because the key admits one lock per row per tenant and
//! the second insert collides.
//!
//! The row exists to be read by the concurrent-edit check and to name the
//! operation in the conflict it raises, so `bulk_operation_id` is the payload
//! rather than an audit trail. Nothing here ever moves: a lock is inserted when
//! its run enters `committing` and deleted when the run leaves it, and the
//! table's trigger refuses `UPDATE` outright while leaving `DELETE` unguarded —
//! see the migration's module doc for why the asymmetry is the rule.
