//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.pricing_repricing_journal` — one selected price row
//! of one mass-repricing run, and how far that row got
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §6, `inst-mr-journal`).
//!
//! Keyed `(run_id, price_id)`, which is also the dedup key the run's events
//! carry: the journal row and the event about it name the same pair, so a
//! consumer de-duplicating on redelivery and a re-drive skipping applied rows
//! are reading one identity rather than two that have to be kept in step.
//!
//! Only `state`, `failure_reason`, `applied_price_id` and `applied_at` ever
//! move, and only while the row is `pending` — the table's trigger freezes a
//! decided row whole, so an `applied` row cannot later be made to name a
//! different successor.
