//! `SeaORM` entities for the bss-pricing gear (schema `bss`).
//!
//! One module per physical table — the ten Foundation-owned ones and the
//! slice-owned tables that follow them — each tenant-scoped through
//! `SecureORM` (`#[secure(tenant_col = "tenant_id",...)]`) so cross-tenant
//! reads are denied in SQL rather than by a forgotten `WHERE` clause. Column
//! types are chosen to round-trip on **both** backends: `Uuid` reads from
//! Postgres `uuid` and `SQLite` `text`, `OffsetDateTime` from `timestamptz` and
//! `text`, `JsonValue` from `jsonb` and `text`, `Vec<u8>` from `bytea` and
//! `blob`.

/// Declare the entity modules and, from the same list, the roster of them.
///
/// **A second list of these names is a list that goes stale.** `rest_support`'s
/// denial census reads one plane per entity to prove a refused call wrote
/// nothing, and a table it has no plane for reads as a table nothing wrote — so
/// the roster has to come from the declarations rather than from a reader's
/// memory. Adding a module here is the whole cost of adding an entity.
