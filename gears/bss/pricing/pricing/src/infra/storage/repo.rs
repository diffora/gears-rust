//! Typed repositories over the Foundation entities.
//!
//! Six land ahead of the paths that call them, and for the same reason: each
//! carries an invariant rather than a caller convention. The pin-frontier
//! repository's `advance` is forward-only in SQL; the plan repository's draft
//! edits are compare-and-swaps in SQL, with the row-version bump inside the same
//! statement that matches on the version the caller read; the idempotency gate's
//! at-most-once guarantee **is** an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`; the
//! price repository's row and band set are one transaction, because a row whose
//! geometry can land a moment late is a row that is briefly wrong; the plan
//! shape repository replaces a revision's phase chain wholesale under the
//! **revision's** entity tag, because a child set with a tag of its own would
//! let two authors edit one draft and both satisfy their precondition; the
//! policy repository resolves a tenant's authoring caps **against the deployment
//! defaults**, so no caller can read a per-tenant cap without the ratified value
//! behind it. None of those guards survives being reimplemented per call site —
//! that is what makes them repositories and not helpers.
//!
//! The remaining tables get their repositories with the paths that write them —
//! a repository nothing calls is dead code, and dead code fails CI here.
//! Three of them arrive together with the publish commit — `pricing_audit_log`,
//! `pricing_outbox` and `pricing_catalog_version_ref` — because that is the
//! first path that has an actor, a subject and a transaction to commit inside
//! of. All three are shaped differently from the six above and deliberately so:
//! they take a **runner** rather than a provider, because a record, an event or
//! a pending version handle that could commit separately from the mutation it
//! describes is evidence of something that may not have happened (D-14 for the
//! audit row; the outbox's own "an event exists if and only if its commit
//! happened"; a dangling pending ref that trips the commit-overdue alarm for a
//! publish that never occurred). [`idempotency_repo`] set that precedent for the
//! same reason.
//!
//! [`read_model_repo`] is the fourth runner-taking one, and its reason is
//! sharper still: D-136 requires the pin frontier to advance **in the
//! transaction that sets the last outstanding `warm_completed` marker** of the
//! frontier's next version in order, so the delta write and the advance are one
//! transaction by rule rather than by preference — and a repository holding a
//! provider could not join it, `Db::conn()` being refused outright inside an
//! open transaction.
