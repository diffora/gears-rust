//! Create `bss.pricing_bundle_component` — the components of **one bundle
//! revision** (`design/08-bundles.md` §6, D-92 + D-105), keyed
//! `(bundle_id, plan_revision, component_plan_id)`.
//!
//! # The key carries `component_plan_id`, and the omission it repairs was fatal
//!
//! D-105, the same repair `pricing_plan_addon_rule` records one slice over.
//! D-92's *"keyed `(bundle_id, plan_revision)`"* admits **one** component per
//! revision, and one row cannot hold the data this slice's rules are written
//! over: *"every referenced component MUST have a covering published row in each
//! `(currency, region)`"* (`inst-bc-coverage`) quantifies over a set, the
//! frequency-match rule (`inst-bc-frequency`) compares components to each other,
//! and `COMPONENT_IS_BUNDLE` is a property of one member of a set. All three
//! were unsatisfiable by construction, and none would have failed a test — a
//! bundle simply could never reach the state the rule rejects.
//!
//! `plan_revision` is the copy-on-new-revision half (D-92, D-83 semantics
//! verbatim): a new revision copies these rows under its own number and the open
//! draft edits its own copies.
//!
//! # `component_plan_id` is in the key, so it is required on every basis
//!
//! §6 marks it *"required for `sum_of_parts`, B1"*, which reads as optional on
//! an `own_price` bundle. D-105's primary key does not admit that: a key column
//! is `NOT NULL`. The two are reconciled in the direction the key forces —
//! a component reference always names a component plan — and it costs nothing,
//! because `inst-bb-own` requires an `own_price` bundle to carry a
//! matching-currency component set anyway (Slice 4 case iii). A component row
//! that named no plan would be a row the coverage walk cannot evaluate. The
//! divergence from §6's wording is reported rather than smoothed over.
//!
//! # `tenant_id` is not in §6's column list, and is here anyway
//!
//! §6's preamble calls these tables "tenant-scoped, `SecureORM`" and
//! `01-foundation.md` §3.7 says it of every physical table in this gear;
//! `Scopable` has nowhere else to read the tenant from. The value is copied from
//! the parent bundle by the repository and never taken from a request (Global
//! Constraint 9): the foreign key covers `bundle_id` alone, so nothing here
//! stops a child carrying a different tenant from the row it points at.
//!
//! # No foreign key on `component_plan_id` or `included_sku_id`
//!
//! `component_plan_id` names a **published plan of another SKU**, which is a
//! `(plan_id, revision)` pair this column does not carry — and whose publication
//! is exactly what `COMPONENT_UNPUBLISHED` checks at publish rather than at
//! insert, because a draft composition may legally reference a plan that has not
//! published yet. `included_sku_id` points outside this gear entirely, into the
//! product/SKU registry. Neither referent is a row this schema holds.
//!
//! **The isolation half of that, which this doc did not state** (review A1-6, and
//! the answer to it): `component_plan_id` is client-supplied, so the question is
//! not only *when* the reference is resolved but *in whose scope*.
//! `infra::bundle::component_defects` makes all three of its reads through
//! `.secure()` under the caller's scope, so a **published** plan in another tenant
//! contributes `Unpublished` and nothing else — indistinguishable from an id
//! nobody holds, sentence for sentence. That is asserted rather than argued, in
//! `rest_bundles::a_component_in_another_tenant_reads_exactly_like_an_absent_one`,
//! against a *published* foreign plan specifically: a foreign draft would answer
//! the same way with the scoping removed, so it could not tell the two apart. The
//! key here is rooted in a server-minted `bundle_id`, so there is no slot for a
//! stranger to take either.
//!
//! # Append-only with its revision (D-92; `01-foundation.md` §3.7, the L-2 fix)
//!
//! Identical in shape to `pricing_plan_addon_rule`'s and identical deliberately.
//! There is no `lifecycle_state` on this table — the owning plan revision's is
//! the referent — but unlike the Slice-2 children this table does not carry
//! `plan_id`, so the predicate resolves it **through `pricing_bundle`**: join the
//! bundle to find its plan, then read that plan revision's state. That join is
//! also the enforcement of the `plan_id` reference D-105 asked for and which
//! `pricing_bundle` itself cannot declare (see `m20260802_000024`'s module doc).
//!
//! Without the trigger, the component set of a frozen revision could be
//! rewritten under an unchanged `pricing_plan`, and the projector's warm
//! re-drive — which reads truth rows (§4.4) — would quietly re-materialize a
//! frozen `CatalogVersion` at a different composition. That is D-92's stated
//! defect, and a rev-share re-split or a component swap is vendor payout and
//! customer entitlement respectively, which is why D-104 makes both
//! always-material.
//!
//! INSERT is guarded and not only UPDATE and DELETE, because an INSERT is the
//! one verb that **adds** a component to a frozen revision. An UPDATE is checked
//! against **both** ends: the `OLD` parent, whose freeze governs the row now, and
//! the `NEW` parent, whose freeze forbids the append — re-pointing a child row's
//! `plan_revision` is precisely how one would otherwise append to a frozen
//! revision without ever issuing an INSERT.
//!
//! **`abandoned` is not `draft`**, so a repository dropping a discarded draft's
//! composition must do it **before** it flips the revision, and a copy-forward
//! must run **after** the new revision row is inserted. Both orderings are forced
//! by this trigger rather than chosen.
//!
//! **Backend differences.** Postgres carries the rule as one PL/pgSQL trigger
//! function with the offending state interpolated; `SQLite` has no procedural
//! language and `RAISE(ABORT, ...)` takes a literal message, so the same rule
//! becomes three fixed-message triggers, one per DML verb, whose parent lookup is
//! a `WHERE NOT EXISTS` subquery in the trigger **body** — a `SQLite` `WHEN`
//! clause may not contain a subquery. `uuid` becomes `text` and the `bss.`
//! qualification is dropped, as elsewhere in this chain. Every `CHECK`, index, FK
//! and PK is preserved on both sides.
