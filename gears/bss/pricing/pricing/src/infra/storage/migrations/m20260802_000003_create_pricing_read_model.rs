//! Create `bss.pricing_read_model` — the published, frozen read model, stored
//! as **per-subject deltas** (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7, D-86 / D-91) and
//! keyed `(tenant_id, catalog_version, subject_kind, subject_ref)`. A version's
//! rows are exactly the subjects of the publish units that produced it, never a
//! full tenant copy: interactive publishes coalesce on a 5s SLO, and a whole
//! catalog per version would multiply a tenant's catalog by its publish rate.
//!
//! `warm_completed` is a **per-row** marker (D-86/D-91), not a per-version one:
//! a version's row is ignored until both `CatalogVersionPublished` and that
//! row's marker are present.
//!
//! `idx_pricing_read_model_resolve` is the index resolution runs on:
//! `(tenant_id, subject_kind, subject_ref, catalog_version DESC)` turns
//! "resolve `(pin, subject)`" — the greatest completed version at or below the
//! pin — into a single indexed read, which is what keeps it inside the
//! p95 < 100ms order-time budget.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no** append-only trigger here. This table is a
//! projection, not truth: the projector rebuilds a row on a degraded-publish
//! re-drive, and the frozen-content guarantee is enforced upstream on the truth
//! tables it reads (`pricing_plan`, `pricing_price`). What it does carry is a
//! `CHECK` tying the completion marker to its timestamp, so a row can never be
//! warm-complete with no record of when it completed.
//!
//! **Backend differences.** `jsonb` becomes `text` on `SQLite` (its JSON1
//! functions read text fine, but there is no binary JSON type and no
//! jsonb-specific indexing); `boolean` is a `SQLite` affinity over 0/1 integers.
//! Both backends support the descending index column and the partial index.
