//! Create `bss.pricing_price` — the price rows, and with them the price
//! **history** (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7): superseded rows are retained
//! in this same table, chained by `supersedes_price_id`; there is no separate
//! history table and no row is ever moved or deleted.
//!
//! The eight canonical scope-key columns (`plan_id`, `currency`, `region`,
//! `price_overlay`, `phase`, `price_eligibility`, `charge_kind`, `cohort` —
//! §4.1) carry a partial `UNIQUE` over `lifecycle_state = 'published'`: at most
//! one **current** row per key. `cohort` is stored as a `NOT NULL` text token
//! (`none`, or the cutover instant) rather than a nullable timestamp precisely
//! because it is an index column — distinct `NULL`s compare as distinct in a
//! Postgres unique index, so a nullable cohort would let two current rows share
//! a key.
//!
//! Both scope-key indexes lead with **`tenant_id`**, which the key itself does
//! not carry. The sibling index over the same table — Slice 2's
//! meter-injectivity partial `UNIQUE` (`02-plan-definition.md` §6, below) — was
//! review-fixed *to* `(tenant_id, plan_id, ...)`, and two indexes on one table
//! that disagree about whether a uniqueness scope starts at the tenant are two
//! different answers to "how far does this row's uniqueness reach". Nothing
//! observable moves today, because `plan_id` is a uuid and a plan belongs to one
//! tenant; what moves is that the index no longer relies on that being true.
//!
//! A **second** partial `UNIQUE` covers `lifecycle_state = 'draft'`, and it is
//! not symmetry. The published index cannot see a draft, so two concurrent
//! authoring calls on one key both find the key free and both commit — landing
//! exactly the second draft that `03-price-structure.md` `inst-pr-return`
//! (D-21) puts scope-key duplication among the save-time checks to refuse, and
//! leaving publish to discover the ambiguity a round trip later. A repository
//! pre-check is a read and cannot decide a race; this index is what does, the
//! way `uq_pricing_plan_open_draft` does for the plan's one editable revision.
//! The two indexes are disjoint by construction, so a key may still hold a
//! draft **and** its published predecessor at once — which is the state the
//! D-88 supersession unit works in, and the reason this is a second index
//! rather than a widened first one.
//!
//! A **third** partial `UNIQUE` — `uq_pricing_price_meter_line_current` — is
//! Slice 2's meter injectivity (`02-plan-definition.md` §6,
//! `inst-cmp-injective` / D-103) said where it can be enforced, and every way
//! it departs from the scope-key index above is load-bearing.
//!
//! It keys **per line, not per plan**. The rule once read "each usage plan
//! revision maps exactly one `meteringUnit`", and that stronger claim was
//! contradicted by three rules of its own slice and enforced by none
//! (D-103, 2026-07-31 review fix): D-84's per-market completeness ranges over
//! "every `(meter, dimensionKey)` line the plan prices", D-43's grants scope to
//! a **set** of metering units on one plan, and this index has always carried
//! `meter` **and** `dimension_key` — it implemented the per-line reading while
//! the prose still claimed the per-plan one. A `PaaS` plan pricing cloudlets,
//! storage and egress is one plan, not three. What is ambiguous, and what fails
//! publish, is a **duplicate line within one scope-key slice**.
//!
//! **It has a `published` arm and no `draft` twin, and that asymmetry is
//! deliberate** (review A1-5, recorded here so the question retires). The scope-key
//! pair above has both arms, and the reason its draft arm is load-bearing —
//! a pre-check is a read and cannot decide a race — is a general argument that
//! would apply here too. It does not have to: meter injectivity is stated as a
//! **publish** rule (`inst-cmp-injective`), so a draft holding a duplicate meter
//! line is a state the design admits and refuses one step later, where the whole
//! revision's line set is judged at once. Scope-key duplication is different in
//! kind: D-21 puts it among the **save-time** checks, so a second draft on one key
//! must never land, and only an index can promise that.
//!
//! `charge_kind` is **absent**, which is §6's own spelling and not an omission
//! this migration should repair. A meter is a usage row's column, so the axis
//! would discriminate nothing it is here to discriminate — what it would do is
//! let two rows pricing one line escape each other by disagreeing about their
//! charge kind, which is the ambiguity rather than an escape from it.
//!
//! `dimension_key` is `NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` — the empty-tuple sentinel — for
//! the reason `cohort` is a `NOT NULL` token (2026-07-28 review fix, confirmed
//! 2026-07-31). Undimensioned rows are the *ordinary* usage line, and under a
//! nullable column two of them on one key would compare as distinct here on
//! both engines and both land: the plan would price one meter twice with
//! nothing having objected, which is the very ambiguity this index exists to
//! refuse, in its commonest shape.
//!
//! `cohort` is **in** the key, as ADR-0002's generation axis. Without it a
//! second grandfathering cutover on a usage line would collide with the
//! generation the first cutover retained — the index would then refuse the
//! cutover instead of the duplicate, and the one operation that legitimately
//! adds a row to a line is the one it stopped.
//!
//! The predicate is `lifecycle_state = 'published'`, the same one the scope-key
//! index carries and sufficient for the same reason (2026-07-30 review fix): a
//! predecessor reads `superseded` the instant its successor commits. It is
//! deliberately **not** scoped by plan revision — an earlier spelling named a
//! `plan_revision` column `pricing_price` does not have — and the FR's "per
//! plan revision" reading is realized as current-rows-per-plan, historical
//! revisions keeping theirs through the supersession chain.
//!
//! `AND meter IS NOT NULL` is this migration's **addition** to that spelling
//! rather than the design's words, and it is semantically inert: a NULL `meter`
//! compares as distinct from every other value in a unique index on both
//! engines, so such a row could not have collided here in any case. What the
//! conjunct buys is that the index holds no entry at all for the recurring,
//! one-time and setup rows it can never speak about.
//!
//! `row_version` — the row's `ETag` — is here because Foundation §3.7 **omits**
//! it rather than because §3.7 asks for it, and that omission is a defect this
//! migration reports rather than reconciles. The bullet lists "ETag/row-version"
//! on `pricing_plan` and leaves it off `pricing_price`, while three normative
//! surfaces each require a **per-row** entity tag on price rows:
//! `03-price-structure.md` §5 gives
//! `PATCH /bss-pricing/v1/plans/{planId}/prices/{priceId}` — "Update a draft
//! row" — the idempotency column `ETag`; `12-operator-efficiency.md`
//! `inst-bk-phase1` / `inst-bk-phase2` (D-118) have a bulk import edit "existing
//! draft rows under their `ETags`" with a conflict failing "only that row",
//! which is unsayable unless the tag is per row; and
//! `07-pricewindow-linkage.md` `inst-co-single-pending` draws the boundary
//! itself — "`ETag` protects rows, this rule protects change units". A per-row
//! rule needs a per-row column, so the column lands here and the design set is
//! left to record the omission.
//!
//! The physical guard is the append-only trigger with a **column whitelist**
//! (§4.3). A published row permits exactly two moves: the state-machine
//! transition `published -> superseded` (its two sanctioned producers are the
//! supersession unit and the grandfathering cutover commit, D-100), and
//! **monotonic tightening** of `grandfather_until` — setting it when null, or
//! moving it earlier. Loosening it (clearing it, or moving it later) is
//! rejected, as is any change to a price, scope or model column; DELETE of a
//! non-draft row is always rejected. Never-published draft rows stay mutable
//! and deletable.
//!
//! **The draft plane is guarded for transitions too (D-153, 2026-08-03, amended
//! in place while building the publish commit).** A column whitelist is scoped
//! to *published* rows by construction, so it says nothing about where a
//! **draft** row may go — and this trigger returned early for one. The price
//! row's state machine (`03-price-structure.md` §4) has exactly one edge out of
//! `draft`, to `published`, and until now nothing physical held it. A draft row
//! moved straight to `superseded` satisfies every constraint on this table and
//! lands **outside both** partial `UNIQUE` predicates: its key reads free on the
//! published plane *and* on the draft plane, so the guarantee D-148 had just
//! bought — the second concurrent creator is refused — is undone by one UPDATE,
//! and `inst-ps-nodelete` then makes the ghost undeletable, on a key no
//! supersession chain reaches because the row was never current. The trigger now
//! constrains the draft row's `lifecycle_state` as well: `draft -> draft |
//! published` and nothing else, exactly as `pricing_plan`'s
//! `trg_pricing_plan_draft_flip_whitelist` does for its own state set (D-145).
//! **No new code** — no API offers the transition and no caller can provoke it;
//! this is the physical floor under a state machine the engine already honours,
//! the same posture as the D-148 index itself.
//!
//! `row_version` is frozen by that same whitelist, alongside the content it
//! tags. An entity tag denotes a representation, and a published row's
//! representation cannot change — so a tag that moved under it would tell a
//! caller its cached copy is stale when it is not, and turn every `If-Match`
//! submit that had correctly read the row into a spurious `STALE_VERSION`. The
//! tag advances only where content does: on the draft plane.
//!
//! **Backend differences.** As in the plan table, Postgres uses one PL/pgSQL
//! trigger with interpolated messages and `SQLite` uses five `RAISE(ABORT, ...)`
//! triggers with literal ones. One further `SQLite` caveat is real rather than
//! cosmetic: `grandfather_until` is `text` there, so the monotonicity comparison
//! is **lexicographic**, which coincides with chronological order only for the
//! canonical fixed-width UTC rendering `SeaORM` writes. Postgres compares
//! `timestamptz` values.
//!
//! **The Slice-3 columns** (`design/03-price-structure.md` §6) —
//! `quantity_source`, `manual_quantity`, `package_size`,
//! `package_price_minor` — are slice-owned on this Foundation-owned table, and
//! they land on the row rather than in a table of their own because each is
//! single-valued per row: a `package` row's block size belongs to that row the
//! way `amount_minor` belongs to a `flat` one. Only the band set is
//! many-per-row, so only the band set gets a child table
//! (`m20260802_000011_create_pricing_price_tier_band`).
//!
//! §6's structural-exclusivity rule splits along that same line, and its
//! package half is here: package fields are permitted only on
//! `model_kind = 'package'`, which is a statement about one row and therefore
//! sayable as a row CHECK. The band half — band rows forbidden unless the kind
//! is `graduated` or `volume` — reads the parent from the child and is a
//! trigger over there.
//!
//! That CHECK spells the kind test `model_kind IS NOT NULL AND
//! model_kind = 'package'` rather than the shorter `model_kind = 'package'`,
//! and the longer form is the whole constraint. `model_kind` is nullable — a
//! draft may be authored before its kind is — so on a **kindless** row the
//! short comparison evaluates to NULL, `FALSE OR NULL` is NULL, and both
//! engines count a NULL CHECK result as satisfied. The rule would then admit
//! exactly the row it exists to refuse: package block fields with no kind to
//! give them meaning, which no Slice-3 rule reads and no rating applies. The
//! band half of the same §6 rule already says this out loud — its trigger tests
//! `parent_kind IS NULL OR parent_kind NOT IN (...)` and names the state
//! `kindless` in its message — so the two halves now refuse the same row.
//!
//! **Every token column is `CHECK`-constrained to the set its domain enum
//! renders**, and the ones that are only ever written by this gear are no
//! exception. `infra::storage::repo::price_repo` reads each of them back
//! through the inverse of that enum's `as_str()` and answers
//! [`RepoError::CorruptRow`] for anything else, on the stated ground that a
//! foreign token is an invariant breach rather than a caller mistake. That
//! ground is only true if the column cannot hold such a token in the first
//! place: without the CHECK, one `UPDATE` from a migration script or a
//! console session leaves a row that every read of it answers as an internal
//! fault forever, with nothing in the schema having objected at the moment the
//! value landed. Every one of them therefore has a negative case in
//! `tests/sqlite_price_checks.rs`, because a repository that writes only legal
//! values catches a CHECK that is too *narrow* and never one that has stopped
//! refusing. The one token no row CHECK can reach is `rolloverPolicy`, which
//! lives **inside** the `included_allowance` jsonb.
//!
//! `price_eligibility` admits **three** classes, not the two the grandfathering
//! cutover moves between: `new_subscriptions_only` is normative in its own right
//! (PRD §1.4 glossary and §6.9, AC #59, `07-pricewindow-linkage.md` W3 /
//! `inst-el-fields` / `inst-el-msw`, D-78, D-132) and sits between the other two
//! in the most-specific-wins order. It pairs with `cohort = 'none'` like
//! `all_subscriptions` does, so the biconditional below is unaffected — the
//! cohort axis discriminates *retained* generations and this class retains
//! nobody — and so is the `grandfather_until` pairing, which stays exclusive to
//! `existing_grandfathered`.
//!
//! `lifecycle_state` is the one token column whose CHECK is deliberately
//! **narrower** than the enum that renders it. `domain::lifecycle::LifecycleState`
//! is shared with plan revisions, which legitimately reach `retired`
//! (`01-foundation.md` §3.7, D-128) and `abandoned` (D-145); the **price-row**
//! state machine (`03-price-structure.md` §4) has three states — draft,
//! published, superseded — and no edge to either. A row in either state would
//! fall outside both partial `UNIQUE` indexes below, so the
//! one-current-row-per-key guarantee would simply stop covering it: the key
//! would read as free and take a second published row beside it. `abandoned`
//! has nothing to express here in any case — D-145 is scoped to the plan
//! revision row, and a never-published **draft price row stays deletable**
//! (§4.3, `inst-ps-nodelete`), which is why `DELETE` below is rejected for
//! published rows only while `pricing_plan` rejects it outright.
//!
//! [`RepoError::CorruptRow`]: crate::infra::storage::RepoError::CorruptRow
//!
//! `included_allowance` is a **Slice-10-declared** column
//! (`design/10-advanced-primitives.md` §6) carried here ahead of its slice, and
//! nothing of that slice's behaviour comes with it: no declaration is compiled,
//! no `$0` band is synthesized, no marker is projected (D-45 / D-130 are
//! Slice-10 work). It is a column because two standing pieces of this gear
//! already read the field — `domain::price_row::PriceRow` carries it, and the
//! D-129 supersession-unit guard compares it across a `carry` row's successor —
//! and a row storage without the column would let the round trip drop the one
//! field that guard looks at, which the guard would then read as "nothing
//! changed" rather than as an error.
//!
//! All five join the frozen-column whitelist, for the reason the whitelist
//! exists: they are content, and a published row's content does not move.
