//! Create `bss.pricing_policy_object` — the tenant policy objects
//! (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7): the approval threshold, the tax-display
//! policy, the optional tenant **default rounding policy**, the
//! enforced-migration notice period, and **every other per-tenant configurable
//! this gear promises** (D-152).
//!
//! Every default here is the **fail-safe** one, and the nullability encodes it.
//! `approval_threshold_minor` is nullable because absence must mean "the
//! two-person rule applies", not "everything is below threshold": the rule
//! applies unless a threshold is explicitly configured and the change is below
//! it and it is not a first publish (§4.2 step 3). `default_rounding_policy_ref`
//! is nullable for the mirror-image reason — a tenant without one simply
//! requires every published row to carry its own `rounding_policy_ref`, and an
//! unresolved policy fails publish with `ROUNDING_POLICY_UNRESOLVED` rather than
//! picking a rounding mode quietly (PRD §17.4).
//!
//! The physical guards are the notice-period floor
//! (`enforced_migration_notice_days >= 60`, D-49 — Slice 11 validates it again
//! at scheduling, but a floor that lives only in application code is one
//! migration script away from being bypassed) and the amount/currency
//! co-nullability `CHECK`, since a threshold amount with no currency is not a
//! threshold at all.
//!
//! # The five columns D-152 added, and the defect they close
//!
//! Four ratified numbers (PRD §7.1 `nfr-size-limits` — 100 tier bands per row,
//! 500 price rows per plan, 366 days and 24 months of custom interval) and the
//! descriptor required-set extension (S2 P5 / `inst-ds-sufficient`) were each
//! described as **tenant-configurable** while naming no store at all. The only
//! carrier the code had was the gear's configuration section, which is per
//! **deployment**: every tenant of a deployment shared one cap, and the
//! descriptor set's "config-extensible without a schema change" promise had
//! nowhere to declare the extension, so a fourth required key could only arrive
//! as a migration against the very table Billing's countersign is still pending
//! on. Sharing one required-set across a deployment is the sharper half — it
//! would let one deployment's tenants share a Billing contract they do not
//! share.
//!
//! **The four cap columns are nullable and the absent reading is the ratified
//! launch value**, taken from the deployment section, so nothing about the
//! ratified numbers moves for a tenant that configures nothing. Each carries a
//! positivity `CHECK` for the reason the configuration section refuses a zero at
//! boot: a zero band or row cap makes every plan unpublishable and a zero
//! interval cap makes every custom frequency unpublishable, and a cap that
//! rejects everything looks exactly like a cap that is switched on.
//!
//! `additional_required_descriptors` is a JSON **array of key names**, matched
//! against `pricing_plan_descriptor_set.additional_fields` and additive over the
//! pinned v1 three — `jsonb` on Postgres and `text` on `SQLite`, the same
//! transform the add-on edge sets and `included_allowance` take. It is
//! `NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'` because an empty array is what "no extension" is, and
//! a nullable column would give that state two spellings. There is deliberately
//! no column for the v1 three: they are pinned by D-48, the extension is
//! additive-only, and a stored set that could *drop* one would let a tenant
//! publish past a pinned element of Billing's contract.
//!
//! **The carrier is provisional** (D-152's veto confirmation, 2026-08-03). These
//! five columns live in a pricing table because there is no settings gear in
//! this repository to hold them; `gears/simple-user-settings` is not that gear
//! (its rows are keyed per **user**, so a tenant-wide cap has no row to occupy).
//! Expect the move, and do not read these columns as the claim that a per-tenant
//! cap belongs in a pricing gear's policy table.
//!
//! **Backend differences.** None beyond the systematic type mirror
//! (`uuid` -> `text`, `timestamptz` -> `text`, `jsonb` -> `text`).
