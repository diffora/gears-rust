//! Create `bss.pricing_plan_phase` — the phase chain of **one plan revision**
//! (`design/02-plan-definition.md` §6), keyed
//! `(tenant_id, plan_id, plan_revision, phase_id)`. The
//! first of Slice 2's three revision-scoped child tables, and the one the
//! canonical scope key points at.
//!
//! **Two halves of the key are the phase's own and two are its scope.**
//! `plan_revision` is
//! there because a plan's shape versions with its revision: a new revision
//! **copies** the phase rows under its own number and the open draft edits its
//! own copies (D-83). `phase_id` is there unchanged, and its stability is the
//! whole point — the `phase` axis of the canonical scope key holds a **bare**
//! `phase_id` (D-19), and same-key supersession compares it (D-56). Re-minting
//! an id on a new revision would move every continuing price row onto a key
//! nothing else is filed under: the rows would stop superseding their
//! predecessors, phase coverage would judge a chain nobody authored, and the
//! damage would first be visible as a rating miss on a plan that published
//! cleanly.
//!
//! **`tenant_id` is not in §6's column list, and is here anyway.** §6's own
//! preamble calls these tables "tenant-scoped, `SecureORM`" and
//! `01-foundation.md` §3.7 says it of every physical table in this gear;
//! `Scopable` has nowhere else to read the tenant from. The omission is
//! reported rather than treated as a decision. The value is copied from the
//! parent revision by the repository and never taken from a request (Global
//! Constraint 9): the foreign key covers the plan key alone, so nothing here
//! stops a child carrying a different tenant from the row it points at, and
//! under `SecureORM` such a child is invisible to its true owner while still
//! joined by key to their plan.
//!
//! # At most one terminal phase, and the other half of the rule is not here
//!
//! `uq_pricing_plan_phase_terminal` is a partial `UNIQUE` over
//! `(plan_id, plan_revision) WHERE converts_to_phase_id IS NULL`: a revision
//! may not hold two phases with no successor. §6 is explicit that the
//! **existence** of exactly one terminal phase is the `PhaseGraph` pipeline's
//! rule (`inst-ph-graph`, `PHASE_GRAPH_INVALID`) — an index cannot enforce the
//! `>= 1` half, because a row is what an index sees and "there is no such row"
//! is not a row. Nobody should later try to "strengthen" this index into the
//! whole rule; what they would get is a weaker rule wearing the name of the
//! real one, and the zero-terminal chain — the one that leaves every phase
//! conversion resolving to nothing — would still publish.
//!
//! Wholesale replacement of a revision's phase set (`PlanShapeRepo`) is what
//! makes this index authorable at all: re-ordering a chain by moving one row at
//! a time transiently holds two terminals, and the index would refuse an edit
//! whose end state is legal.
//!
//! # Three constraints this table deliberately does NOT carry
//!
//! Each is a real rule, and each belongs to the validation pipeline, which
//! judges a shape the author assembled and owes them **one report enumerating
//! every finding**. A constraint here would answer with a driver error instead
//! — an internal fault where a line an operator can act on was owed — and would
//! refuse a half-authored draft besides, since a phase graph is authored in
//! successive `PATCH`es rather than all at once.
//!
//! 1. **No `CHECK` pairing `phase_duration_days` with terminality.** §6's "Key
//!    constraints" paragraph lists none, and `inst-ph-duration` assigns the
//!    rule — required `> 0` on every non-terminal phase, forbidden on the
//!    terminal one — to the pipeline as `PHASE_DURATION_INVALID`. An author who
//!    sets a successor in one request and its duration in the next passes
//!    through the state such a CHECK would forbid.
//! 2. **No `CHECK` that a terminal phase's `kind` is `evergreen`.** C-4 gives
//!    that rule its own code, `TERMINAL_PHASE_KIND_INVALID`, for the same
//!    authoring reason: terminality is structural
//!    (`converts_to_phase_id IS NULL`) and the `kind` column is independent of
//!    it, which is exactly the pair the rule exists to reject.
//! 3. **No foreign key on `converts_to_phase_id`.** "No dangling target" is
//!    `inst-ph-graph`'s rule. A self-referential FK would forbid authoring
//!    phase A's successor before phase B exists — the ordinary way a chain is
//!    written — and would answer a genuinely dangling edge with a constraint
//!    violation rather than a report line naming the phase.
//!
//! A **floor** is none of those three rules, and it does sit here.
//! `chk_pricing_plan_phase_duration_non_negative` and
//! `chk_pricing_plan_phase_trial_projection_non_negative` refuse a negative day
//! count and nothing else: neither requires a duration nor forbids one, so the
//! half-authored draft point 1 protects still saves. What they close is the
//! poisoned row. Both columns are read back through `u32::try_from` and a
//! negative answers `CorruptRow`, which is an internal fault on **every** later
//! read of the revision — past the point where the pipeline's report could be
//! reached at all, and unreachable by any correction this gear offers.
//!
//! # `display_trial_days` may not drift from its source
//!
//! `chk_pricing_plan_phase_display_trial_days` is §6's, verbatim: a `trial`
//! phase publishes `displayTrialDays` as the PRD-named projection of its
//! `phaseDurationDays` (`inst-ph-trial`), one value under two persisted names,
//! and the two may never disagree (2026-07-28 review fix). Subscriptions reads
//! the published projection as its single source for trial runtime, so a drift
//! here is a trial that ends on a different day than the catalog says it does.
//!
//! The CHECK is satisfied when `display_trial_days` is NULL — an untaken
//! projection — and, by SQL's NULL propagation, **also when
//! `phase_duration_days` is NULL while `display_trial_days` is set**: the
//! comparison is then NULL, which both engines count as satisfied. That
//! remaining shape is a trial phase projecting a duration it does not have, and
//! it is refused at publish rather than here, by the two rules already named:
//! a non-terminal phase without a duration is `PHASE_DURATION_INVALID`, and a
//! terminal one carrying the `trial` kind is `TERMINAL_PHASE_KIND_INVALID`.
//! Closing it with an extra `phase_duration_days IS NOT NULL` conjunct would
//! make exactly the half-authored draft the paragraph above protects unsavable,
//! so the schema stands behind the pipeline here rather than in front of it.
//!
//! # Append-only with its revision (`01-foundation.md` §3.7, the L-2 fix)
//!
//! Every revision-scoped child table carries the same discipline as its parent:
//! child rows are physically immutable once **their** revision publishes, while
//! a draft revision's copies stay freely mutable and deletable. There is no
//! `lifecycle_state` on this table — the parent revision's is the referent —
//! so the predicate reads `pricing_plan.lifecycle_state = 'draft'` for
//! `(plan_id, plan_revision)`, exactly as `pricing_price_tier_band` reads its
//! parent price row. Without it, the phase set of a frozen revision could be
//! rewritten under an unchanged `pricing_plan`, and the projector's warm
//! re-drive — which reads truth rows (§4.4) — would quietly re-materialize a
//! frozen `CatalogVersion` at a different shape.
//!
//! INSERT is guarded and not only UPDATE and DELETE, because an INSERT is the
//! one verb that **adds** a phase to a frozen revision. An UPDATE is checked
//! against **both** ends: the `OLD` parent, the revision the row is bound to
//! now, whose freeze governs it; and the `NEW` parent, the revision the row
//! would land under, whose freeze forbids the append. That is not
//! belt-and-braces — re-pointing a child row's `plan_revision` is precisely how
//! one would otherwise append to a frozen revision without ever issuing an
//! INSERT.
//!
//! **`abandoned` is not `draft`**, and the ordering that follows from it is
//! mandatory rather than stylistic. D-145 drops a discarded revision's child
//! copies; the moment the revision row reads `abandoned` this trigger refuses
//! the DELETE, so `PlanRepo::abandon_draft` drops the phase rows **before** it
//! flips the revision, in one transaction. The mirror-image ordering holds on
//! the way in: `PlanRepo::open_revision` inserts the new revision row first,
//! because the INSERT arm reads the *new* parent and requires it to be `draft`.
//!
//! **Backend differences.** Postgres carries the rule as one PL/pgSQL trigger
//! function with the offending state interpolated; `SQLite` has no procedural
//! language and `RAISE(ABORT, ...)` takes a literal message, so the same rule
//! becomes three fixed-message triggers, one per DML verb, whose parent lookup
//! is a `WHERE NOT EXISTS` subquery in the trigger **body**.
//!
//! The body rather than a `WHEN` clause is this chain's spelling for a guard that
//! reads another row, and **not** an engine limitation: a `SQLite` `WHEN` does
//! accept a subquery — `pricing_approval_key`'s triggers put a scalar `SELECT` in
//! four of theirs and they enforce, and sqlite 3.51 admits `WHEN NOT EXISTS (…)`
//! directly. The
//! body form is taken so each arm's condition sits beside the message it raises,
//! one trigger per arm of the PL/pgSQL function.
//!
//! `uuid` becomes `text` and the `bss.` qualification is dropped, as elsewhere in
//! this chain. Every CHECK, index, FK and PK is preserved on both sides.
//!
//! # Why the scope is in the key, and what the key still refuses
//!
//! `tenant_id` and `plan_id` are in the primary key by D-340, and without them the
//! key asserts something nobody ever argued: that a phase id belongs to **one plan
//! per revision number across the whole table**, every tenant's included. Two
//! consequences, and the second is the serious one.
//!
//! An operator seeding several drafts with one phase id gets exactly one plan that
//! can attach it; the rest collide at every revision number they will ever hold, and
//! since a scope key **is** a price row's identity (`01-foundation.md` §3.7) those
//! rows cannot be re-pointed at a different phase either — leaving deletion as the
//! only remedy. Measured on the stand 2026-08-17: five drafts, one shared phase id,
//! four of them unrepairable through the API.
//!
//! And the reach is every `plan × write` holder, not a script's. The `phases` PATCH
//! facet takes `phase_id` from the client — which is what makes D-19's clone remap
//! and D-83's copy-forward expressible at all — so the difference between a `500`
//! and a `200` answers *is this id in use somewhere I cannot read*: a probe of
//! another tenant's phase ids, on a table this gear scopes by `tenant_id`
//! everywhere else.
//!
//! **What the key still refuses is not a leftover.**
//! `(tenant_id, plan_id, plan_revision, phase_id)` admits exactly one row per
//! `(plan, revision, phase)`, so one revision may still not hold the same phase id
//! twice. `inst-ph-graph` walks a chain and `inst-ph-default` speaks of *the*
//! terminal phase, and both are written as though a phase id names at most one row
//! of a revision. A key that also admitted the duplicate would fix the collision
//! above and quietly make the graph rules judge a chain nobody can author. The
//! paired probes in `tests/sqlite_plan_phase.rs` are one per direction for that
//! reason.
//!
//! `uq_pricing_plan_phase_terminal` is partial over
//! `(plan_id, plan_revision) WHERE converts_to_phase_id IS NULL` — per plan, not per
//! id — so "at most one terminal phase" was never carried by the primary key and
//! does not depend on its shape. No foreign key in this schema names
//! `pricing_plan_phase`, and `plan_phase::Entity::find_by_id` has no call sites, so
//! the key's arity is not a signature anything spells out.
//!
//! Dependency level 1.
