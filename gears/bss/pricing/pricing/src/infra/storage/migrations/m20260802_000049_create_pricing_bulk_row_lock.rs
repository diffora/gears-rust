//! `pricing_bulk_row_lock` — the bulk lock, as a **side table**
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §6, `inst-bk-lock`, `inst-bs-commit`,
//! `inst-bs-approval`, D-37; Foundation `fr-concurrent-edit`).
//!
//! Slice 12's third group. While a run is committing, the rows it holds are
//! marked here, and an interactive edit targeting one is refused with a conflict
//! **naming the operation** — which is the whole reason the marker is a row with
//! an `bulk_operation_id` on it rather than a boolean anywhere.
//!
//! # Why this is not a column on `pricing_price`
//!
//! A 2026-07-31 review fix, and the earlier "nullable column **or** a lock side
//! table, implementation choice" offered an option that cannot be built: the rows
//! a repricing run locks are **published**, and `pricing_price`'s append-only
//! trigger whitelists exactly two `UPDATE`s on a published row — the
//! `lifecycle_state` flip and a monotonic `grandfather_until` tightening
//! (Foundation §3.7). Writing a lock marker onto the row is refused by that
//! trigger. The side table also releases without touching truth data.
//!
//! # The custody rules, and the one this table deliberately does not have
//!
//! **A lock may be taken only under a run that is `committing`.** §4 is explicit
//! in both directions: `inst-bs-commit` starts the lock on entry to `committing`,
//! and `inst-bs-approval` says rows are **not** locked while a run awaits its
//! approval — so a lock taken early would bounce interactive supersessions on
//! keys the design says are free.
//!
//! **A lock is taken or released, never edited.** `UPDATE` is refused outright.
//! Moving a lock to another operation in place would tell the interactive editor
//! that an operation which never took the row holds it, and would leave the
//! release path — which keys on the operation — unable to find what it owns.
//!
//! **`DELETE` is not guarded at all, and that is the rule rather than an
//! omission.** Both sibling tables of this slice refuse `DELETE` outright, and
//! copying that here would be precisely wrong: a lock is transient, release *is*
//! a delete, and it has to work from every path — the ordinary completion, D-37's
//! operator abort of a stalled run, and a janitor cleaning up after a crash whose
//! run is already terminal. A guard conditioned on the run's state would make a
//! crashed run's locks unreleasable at exactly the moment they most need
//! releasing, which is the freeze D-37's release path exists to prevent: a
//! crashed import must never freeze interactive authoring indefinitely. The
//! trigger is therefore bound to `INSERT OR UPDATE` and not to `DELETE`, so the
//! absence is structural rather than a fall-through nobody notices.
//!
//! **The lock's tenant is its run's tenant.** The foreign key covers
//! `bulk_operation_id` alone, so without this arm one tenant's run could mark
//! another tenant's price row — and the concurrent-edit check, scoped to the
//! second tenant, would refuse an edit naming an operation that tenant cannot
//! see. Checked in the same lookup the state arm needs, so it costs nothing.
//!
//! **Both `INSERT` arms defer to the foreign key when the run does not exist.**
//! A `BEFORE` trigger answers ahead of the key on either engine, so an arm
//! written as "the run is not this tenant's" would fire for a lock naming *no*
//! run — reporting a tenancy fault the caller does not have, and leaving the key
//! unobservable and therefore unassertable. `pricing_composite_meter` records
//! exactly that shadowing as a limitation; here it is designed out instead, which
//! costs one `EXISTS` conjunct per arm and makes each refusal mean what it says.
//!
//! # No `CHECK` constraints, and one index that is genuinely needed
//!
//! There is no vocabulary column here: every rule this table has is about
//! custody rather than about columns agreeing with each other. The index over
//! `(tenant_id, bulk_operation_id)` is the release path's own query — unlike
//! `pricing_repricing_journal`, whose reads are all run-scoped and covered by its
//! key, this table is keyed for the *reader* (the concurrent-edit check, by
//! price) and swept by the *writer* (release, by operation).
//!
//! # `SQLite`
//!
//! Systematic transforms only: `bss.` dropped, `uuid` -> `text`, `timestamptz`
//! -> `text`, and the one PL/pgSQL function split into fixed-message
//! `RAISE(ABORT, …)` triggers, one per guarded condition. Both `INSERT` arms read
//! the parent run, so they are written as a subquery in the trigger **body**
//! (`SELECT RAISE(ABORT, …) WHERE NOT EXISTS (…)`) rather than in a `WHEN` clause,
//! which may not contain one — `m20260802_000046` carries the same shape for the
//! same reason.
