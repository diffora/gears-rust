//! Create `bss.pricing_idempotency_dedup` — the at-most-once gate and the
//! replay-response source, keyed `(tenant_id, operation, client_key)`
//! (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7).
//!
//! The row holds a hash of the request payload alongside the stored response,
//! and that pairing is the whole mechanism: a replay whose hash **matches**
//! returns the stored response; a replay whose hash **differs** is rejected with
//! `IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH` and is never replayed and never re-executed —
//! the two requests disagree about what they are, so neither answer would be
//! right. The idempotency check runs **before** the `ETag` check.
//!
//! The physical guard is the composite PK. It is the at-most-once gate itself,
//! not an optimization: two concurrent requests carrying the same client key
//! race to insert, and exactly one wins. A uniqueness rule enforced only by a
//! read-then-write in application code would admit both under concurrency,
//! which is the one situation idempotency exists for.
//!
//! `request_hash` is a `bytea` digest rather than the payload: the gate needs
//! to know whether two requests are the same, not what they said, and retaining
//! request bodies here would duplicate the audit trail in a table with no
//! retention story of its own.
//!
//! **The response columns are nullable, and that is the mechanism.** The
//! at-most-once gate is the `PRIMARY KEY` insert itself, so the row has to exist
//! *before* the operation it guards has produced anything to store. Seeding a
//! fabricated status in the meantime would put a value in a column that means
//! "this is what the caller was told" while nobody had been told anything — and
//! a row leaking past its transaction would then replay a fiction. `NULL` is the
//! honest reading of "claimed, not yet answered", and the pairing `CHECK` keeps
//! the two columns from drifting into a half-recorded answer that no reader
//! could interpret.
//!
//! **Backend differences.** `bytea` becomes `blob` and `jsonb` becomes `text` on
//! `SQLite`; nothing behavioural changes. Both `CHECK`s are written in the
//! subset both backends agree on — `IS NULL` yields a comparable value on each,
//! so the pairing constraint needs no dialect-specific spelling.
