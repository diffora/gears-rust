//! `pricing_price`'s frozen-column guard gains the two tax columns (`T-18`).
//!
//! Slice 4 added `tax_category_ref` (`m20260802_000037`) and
//! `resolved_tax_category` (`m20260802_000039`) and put **neither** in either
//! engine's frozen-column guard. `T-18` records only the second; the first was
//! measured missing while paying it, and it is the sharper of the two:
//! `tax_category_ref` is authored draft content that D-48 makes one of the five
//! descriptor elements Billing countersigns, and since the approval pin moved to
//! `v5` it is *inside* the content hash — so a published row whose category a
//! writer outside this crate changed would diverge from the very pin that
//! approved it, silently.
//!
//! # Why a migration of its own rather than an edit to `m20260802_000002`
//!
//! The guard is created there, and the chain is greenfield, so editing it in
//! place is how `meter` and `dimension_key` arrived. It cannot work here: those
//! two are columns of the `CREATE TABLE` itself, while these two arrive by
//! `ALTER` at `000037`/`000039` — **after** `000002` runs. A trigger naming a
//! column that does not exist yet does not create.
//!
//! # What is restated, and what watches the restatement
//!
//! `SQLite` keeps the frozen-column check in a trigger of its own, so this drops
//! and recreates that one trigger and touches nothing else. **Postgres keeps it
//! as one arm of `bss.pricing_price_append_only()`**, a function that also
//! carries the `DELETE` guard, the draft-transition guard, the
//! published→superseded guard and the `grandfather_until` monotonicity guard —
//! neither engine has an incremental form, so the Postgres half is the whole
//! function restated by hand. That is the risk `T-18` names, and it is taken
//! deliberately rather than scripted: this program has twice had a scripted
//! replacement do something other than intended, once deleting whole function
//! bodies.
//!
//! What makes it safe to take is that the restatement is **watched**:
//! `sqlite_migrations` pins trigger **bodies** by digest, not merely their names,
//! and `postgres_schema_price` executes every arm of this function. A
//! restatement that lost an arm reddens there rather than in production.
//!
//! # Where the two columns sit in the list
//!
//! Beside `tax_inclusive`, and in the order `domain::materiality::delta` now
//! compares them: the basis a row is billed on, then the category it is billed
//! under, then the category a publish resolved for it. The list is not sorted by
//! anything, so "beside the fact it belongs to" is the only ordering rule it has.
