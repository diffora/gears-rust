//! The per-column fold and the two column readings, without a database.
//!
//! The fold is where D-152's "a tenant with no entry takes the ratified launch
//! default" actually lives, and it is a **per column** promise: a tenant that
//! configured one cap did not thereby ask for the other three to change. A fold
//! that fell back per row would pass any test written against a tenant with no
//! row at all, which is why the partial row is here rather than only in the
//! database suite.
