//! Repository over `pricing_approval_threshold` **and its tombstone table** — the
//! versioned, per-currency approval-threshold policy (`design/05-governance.md` §6,
//! D-10, D-185).
//!
//! Four operations and no update, which is the store's whole shape. A proposal is
//! [`open_version`]; a **retirement** is [`open_tombstone`]; a reader of one version
//! is [`read_version`]; and [`latest_version`] is what a proposer asks before minting
//! the next number. There is no `apply`, no `activate` and no delete, because a
//! version's content is what an approval's `content_hash` covers and a mutated
//! version would leave a signature over content nobody can reconstruct.
//!
//! # Two tables, **one** version sequence, and this module is where they meet
//!
//! `pricing_approval_threshold` holds one row per currency of a version;
//! `pricing_approval_threshold_tombstone` holds one row per version that has **no**
//! currencies (D-185 — the authored way back to §6's *"unset ⇒ two-person rule
//! always"*, which the entry table alone cannot express, a zero-row version being
//! indistinguishable from a version nobody proposed). They are two tables and one
//! sequence: [`latest_version`] takes the maximum across both and [`versions_desc`]
//! merges both, so a tombstone consumes a number, is walked by the effective-policy
//! resolution, and is superseded by the next proposal exactly as an entry version is.
//!
//! Every reader above this module sees one sequence and never the seam. That is the
//! reason the join lives here rather than in `infra::threshold`: a caller that had to
//! remember to ask both tables is a caller that will one day ask one.
//!
//! # Runner-taking, not provider-holding, and the reason is D-10's
//!
//! Every entry point here takes a [`DBRunner`]. The proposal writes its version
//! rows **and** opens the approval unit that reviews them in one transaction —
//! a version nobody is reviewing is a proposal with no reviewer, and a unit
//! pinning content that failed to commit is a signature over nothing — and a
//! provider-holding repository could not join that transaction at all, `Db::conn()`
//! being refused inside an open one. [`read_model_repo`](super::read_model_repo)
//! set the precedent for the same reason.
//!
//! # Which version is in effect is not this module's answer
//!
//! It is `pricing_approval`'s: the greatest version whose unit an independent
//! principal approved. [`crate::infra::threshold::effective_policy`] composes the
//! two stores; nothing here reads the approval plane, so this module cannot
//! disagree with it.
