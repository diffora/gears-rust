//! The writer of `pricing_outbox` — the transactional enqueue, and the one
//! definition of the `PlanPublished` payload.
//!
//! Transactional is the whole point of the table: **an event exists if and only
//! if its commit happened**. So this module, like
//! [`audit_repo`](super::audit_repo), is stateless and takes a **runner** rather
//! than a provider. An enqueue in a transaction of its own could commit while
//! the publish rolled back — a `PlanPublished` for a plan that is still `draft`,
//! delivered at-least-once to every consumer — or fail while the publish
//! committed, which is a version nothing is ever told about.
//!
//! # Three things this file decides, each with its reason
//!
//! **The sequence is per aggregate and never global.** `seq` is
//! `MAX(seq) + 1` over `(tenant_id, aggregate_id)`, guarded by
//! `uq_pricing_outbox_sequence`. A global sequence would serialize every
//! tenant's publishing behind one counter, and no consumer needs cross-aggregate
//! order — `01-foundation.md` §1.2 orders the frozen event set per
//! `(tenantId, aggregateId)` and says nothing about a total order. The posture
//! is the audit chain's: the read of the head is not the guard, the unique index
//! is, and the loser's whole transaction rolls back.
//!
//! **The dedup key is derived here, never at the call site.** For a plan
//! publish the natural key is the publish unit itself — `(event name, plan_id,
//! revision)` — because a revision publishes exactly **once**: D-90 gives a
//! draft revision one edge out, and the publish commit's compare-and-swap
//! refuses the second attempt. Under `uq_pricing_outbox_dedup_key
//! (tenant_id, dedup_key)` a second `PlanPublished` for one revision therefore
//! fails at the **writer** rather than at every consumer, which is what that
//! index is for. Derived in [`plan_published_dedup_key`] so that no caller can
//! spell it a second way; a dedup key spelled twice is a dedup key that dedups
//! nothing.
//!
//! **`published_at` is NULL and stays NULL.** Draining is the relay's job and no
//! part of the publish commit; `idx_pricing_outbox_undrained` is that relay's
//! cursor. Note also that `config.events_enabled` (default `false`) gates
//! **fan-out, not the row** — [`crate::config`] says so in as many words — so
//! [`enqueue`] is unconditional and never reads the flag. A publish whose row
//! was skipped because fan-out was off would be a publish nothing could ever
//! replay.
//!
//! # The event name comes from one place
//!
//! `NewOutboxEvent` carries a [`CatalogEvent`] rather than a `String`, and the
//! column is written from [`CatalogEvent::as_str`].
//! `chk_pricing_outbox_event_name` pins the same set, so a second spelling
//! *would* be caught — but caught as a driver error inside a publish
//! transaction, which is not where a frozen contract should be discovered.
//! The count is deliberately not in that sentence, and it is not in the two below
//! either: a number here is the one thing in them that can go stale and the only
//! thing they do not need — the CHECK and the enum widen together, the prose does
//! not. `CatalogEvent::ALL` is the roster and `domain::events_tests` is where its
//! size is asserted.
//!
//! ## How to check the discipline holds — and the check that does **not** work
//!
//! Not *"`NewOutboxEvent {` appears only in this file"*. Two sites in
//! [`crate::infra::repricing`] are struct **updates** — `NewOutboxEvent {
//! dedup_key: …,..NewOutboxEvent::price_updated(…) }` — which *extend* a named
//! constructor rather than replacing it: the name, the aggregate and the payload
//! still come from the constructor and only the key moves, to the `(run_id,
//! price_id)` shape `12-operator-efficiency.md` requires of a repricing run. A
//! grep for the opening brace cannot tell that from a literal built from nothing,
//! and it has already reported those two as regressions they are not.
//!
//! What separates the two is the functional-update base, so **count it**:
//!
//! ```text
//! diff <(rg -c 'NewOutboxEvent \{'    src --glob '!**/outbox_repo*.rs') \
//!      <(rg -c '\.\.NewOutboxEvent::' src --glob '!**/outbox_repo*.rs')
//! ```
//!
//! Per file the two counts must be equal: every literal outside this module is a
//! struct update over a constructor, so a from-scratch literal breaks the
//! equality and a struct update preserves it. The other half of the discipline is
//! the **name**: no `CatalogEvent` variant may be spelled as a literal by a
//! *writer*, so
//!
//! ```text
//! rg -n 'format!\("[A-Za-z]*(Published|Updated|Created|Retired|Scheduled|Activated|Expired|Cancelled|Degraded)' \
//!    src --glob '!**/*_tests.rs'
//! ```
//!
//! must come back empty. The exclusion is deliberate and is not a loophole: a
//! test asserting a rendered key spells it independently **on purpose**, which is
//! the only thing that makes the assertion say anything.
//!
//! # A gap this file named, and what filled it
//!
//! [`PricingSnapshotRef`](crate::domain::snapshot::PricingSnapshotRef) has three
//! parts: the version ref, the resolved price ids, and an
//! `evaluation_policy_version`. Until D-162 the commit produced the first two
//! and this file stamped nothing for the third, because no document in this gear
//! or in Rating named a producer or a format for it and a placeholder in a
//! published payload is a value a consumer pins against — the first thing to pin
//! against an invented policy version being the last thing that could tell it
//! was invented (D-161).
//!
//! D-162 gives it a producer: the **evaluation-policy generation**, a declared
//! constant of this gear ([`EVALUATION_POLICY_GENERATION`]) naming which
//! evaluation-policy field set the frozen row content is to be read under. So
//! the payload now carries all three segments. The ban stands — what is stamped
//! is the generation the gear declares and whose roster
//! `01-foundation.md` §4.4 pins, never a filler.
//!
//! # One more naming decision, recorded because nothing else records it
//!
//! **No document declares the `PlanPublished` payload's field list.** The design
//! set fixes the event *name*, the ordering key, the at-least-once delivery and
//! the requirement that the event carry a pending version ref and a correlation
//! key — and nothing else. The wire keys below are therefore this module's, in
//! the `camelCase` the design set spells consumer-visible fields in
//! (`pricingSnapshotRef`, `planId`); they are written here once so a later
//! document has something concrete to contradict.
