//! The writer of `pricing_read_model` — one per-subject delta of one
//! `CatalogVersion`, and the warm set a re-drive subtracts against.
//!
//! Runner-taking free functions rather than a provider-holding struct, and the
//! reason is the sharpest form of [`audit_repo`](super::audit_repo)'s and
//! [`outbox_repo`](super::outbox_repo)'s: **D-136 requires the frontier's
//! advance to happen in the transaction that sets the last outstanding
//! `warm_completed` marker of the frontier's next version in order.** Every
//! write on this path is therefore somebody else's transaction's, and a
//! repository that opened a connection of its own could not participate in it
//! — inside an open transaction `Db::conn()` is refused outright by the
//! toolkit's transaction-bypass guard.
//!
//! # The row is written **warm**, and that is not a shortcut
//!
//! §4.4's marker is per **row** and discriminates a subject that is resolvable
//! from one that is not. In this gear projection and warming are **one act**:
//! the payload is materialized from the truth rows in the same transaction that
//! writes it, so there is no interval in which a delta row exists and is not
//! complete. What the marker therefore discriminates here is *projected* from
//! *not yet projected* — and it stays per row rather than per version because a
//! version's subjects are projected independently (D-91), so a version's
//! completeness is the question "is every one of its ref rows' subjects warm",
//! which is what [`warm_subjects_at`] answers.
//!
//! `chk_pricing_read_model_warm_marker` already makes the marker and its
//! instant move together, so a half-warm row is not expressible on either
//! backend.
//!
//! # An INSERT, never an upsert
//!
//! A completed version never mutates. So a second projection of one
//! `(version, subject)` is either a duplicated sweep or a re-drive that failed
//! to skip an already-warm subject, and in both cases the primary key refusing
//! it is the guard — an upsert would silently rewrite a frozen version's
//! content, which is the one thing a pinned consumer is entitled to assume
//! cannot happen. The refusal arrives as [`RepoError::Db`] rather than a typed
//! variant because no caller can provoke it: the projector is a background
//! sweep with no client, so a refusal here has nobody to report to and no wire
//! code the design set names (D-146's line about the pin frontier, one table
//! over).
//!
//! # The resolution query is here now, and this paragraph is its answer
//!
//! **§4.4's rule** — "resolving `(pin, subject)` reads the subject's row with
//! the greatest `catalog_version <= V` whose `warm_completed` is set" — is
//! [`delta_at`], and `idx_pricing_read_model_resolve` finally has the query it
//! was created for.
//!
//! Until 2026-08-05 this section said the query was **owed**, for a reason that
//! was true when it was written and is not any more: *"there is no read surface
//! to call it"*. There is one — `GET /bss-pricing/v1/plans/{planId}/sellability`,
//! whose four answerable predicates are read off one plan subject's frozen delta
//! — so the shape is no longer one nobody agreed to and the method is no longer
//! dead code. What has **not** changed is the other half of the old paragraph,
//! and it is now stated where it belongs rather than as a reason for an absence:
//! two of the six sellability predicates read facts this gear cannot project at
//! all (D-167 clause 3), and [`crate::domain::sellability`] answers those
//! `NotEvaluable` with the slice that owes each.
//!
//! It is a **read of one subject**, not of a version: the completeness question
//! stays [`warm_subjects_at`]'s, and a caller that wanted a version's whole
//! content would be asking for the payload of every subject in a batch, which no
//! surface asks for.
