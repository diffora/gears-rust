//! Repository for the materialized pin-eligibility frontier
//! (`pricing_pin_frontier`, D-136).
//!
//! Two operations, and the asymmetry between them is the design.
//! [`PinFrontierRepo::read`] is on the consumer path — it is what
//! `GET /bss-pricing/v1/catalog-version/frontier` serves and what a consumer
//! pins for the duration of a resolution run — so it is a single point lookup
//! returning the SDK's [`PinFrontier`], mapped at this boundary so the entity
//! never leaves infrastructure. [`advance`] is on the projector's path and
//! moves the watermark **forward only**.
//!
//! Forward-only is enforced twice, on purpose. The UPDATE carries its own
//! `catalog_version < :to` predicate, so even two projectors racing cannot walk
//! the frontier backwards — whichever loses simply updates nothing. And a
//! request to advance to an equal or lower version is reported as
//! [`RepoError::FrontierRegression`] rather than swallowed as a no-op: the
//! projector advances the frontier only inside the transaction completing the
//! frontier's **next** version in order, so such a request means that ordering
//! assumption has already broken. A receding frontier would let one pin resolve
//! two different contents over time, which is the entire reason the predicate is
//! materialized instead of recomputed; a silent no-op would leave the ordering
//! bug behind it invisible.
//!
//! # The advance is a free function, and it was unusable as a method
//!
//! [`advance`] was written for the projector and had never been called. It was
//! also, as written, **uncallable by it**: it acquired its own connection
//! through `Db::conn()`, while D-136 requires the advance to happen "in the
//! **same transaction** that sets the last outstanding `warm_completed` marker
//! of the frontier's next version in order".
//! [`plan_repo::load_current`](super::plan_repo::load_current)'s doc states the
//! mechanical consequence one table over: inside an open transaction
//! `Db::conn()` "is refused outright by the toolkit's transaction-bypass
//! guard". So the method was not merely reaching for the wrong runner — it
//! could not run at all on the only path D-136 permits it on.
//!
//! It is therefore a runner-taking free function, the shape
//! [`plan_repo::publish_revision`](super::plan_repo::publish_revision) already
//! has, and [`read_at`] joins it so the projector can read the watermark inside
//! its own transaction too. **Nothing about the guarantee moved** — the same
//! `catalog_version < :to` predicate, the same typed refusal, the same
//! argument for refusing rather than swallowing. Only where the statement runs.
//!
//! [`PinFrontierRepo::read`] stays a method, because its caller is the REST
//! path (`api::rest::frontier::get_frontier`, through `ApiState`) and that path
//! is not in a transaction and holds no runner.
//!
//! # One contradiction is recorded here rather than resolved
//!
//! [`repo_failure`](crate::infra::storage::repo_failure) maps
//! [`RepoError::FrontierRegression`] onto `DomainError::LifecycleForbidden`,
//! calling it "a precondition failure, not an internal fault". D-146 says of
//! this exact case the opposite: "a regression there is an internal fault, not
//! a lifecycle refusal, and a wire code for it would document an API a client
//! cannot provoke". They contradict.
//!
//! The mapping is **left alone and the contradiction reported**. Nothing on a
//! wire path can reach either rendering: this variant's first producer is the
//! background sweep landed beside this file, and a background job's error is
//! logged, never rendered. Changing the mapping would move a rendering under a
//! code the design set has already reasoned about, for no observable gain.
