//! Repository for a plan revision's **shape** — the Slice-2 child tables that
//! version with the revision (`design/02-plan-definition.md` §6, D-83).
//!
//! `pricing_plan_phase`, `pricing_plan_addon_rule`,
//! `pricing_plan_descriptor_set`, `pricing_composite_meter` and
//! `pricing_plan_period_floor_cap` are all five of them. It is separate from
//! [`PlanRepo`](super::PlanRepo) because the two answer different questions:
//! that repository owns the revision **chain** — which revision is current,
//! which is open, which numbers are consumed — while this one owns what a single
//! revision *is*. What they share is the revision row's compare-and-swap, and
//! they share it literally: `swap_guard`, `refuse` and `mutable_draft` are
//! [`super::plan_repo`]'s, imported rather than re-spelled.
//!
//! **The child set carries no entity tag of its own, and that is a decision.**
//! A phase edit advances the *plan revision's* `row_version`, which is
//! `price_record.rs`'s argument for tier bands applied to a plan's shape: if
//! editing a phase left the revision's tag alone, two authors editing different
//! phases of one draft would both satisfy `If-Match` and silently interleave —
//! the lost update `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-fr-concurrent-edit` exists to refuse.
//! Every mutating call here therefore takes the revision's `RowVersion` and
//! bumps it in the same statement that matches on it.
//!
//! **The phase set is replaced wholesale, never merged.** That is not a
//! convenience: `uq_pricing_plan_phase_terminal` admits one terminal phase per
//! revision, and re-ordering a chain one row at a time transiently holds two —
//! so a row-by-row edit would be refused by the index for an end state that is
//! perfectly legal. Wholesale replacement is also `PriceRepo`'s band precedent
//! exactly, and for the second reason that one gives: a phase set is judged as a
//! **graph** (`inst-ph-graph`), and a partial update has no graph the rules
//! could evaluate.
//!
//! **A child row's `tenant_id` comes from the parent revision, never from the
//! request** (Global Constraint 9). The foreign key covers
//! `(plan_id, plan_revision)` alone, so nothing in the schema stops a phase row
//! carrying a different tenant from the revision it points at — and under
//! `SecureORM` such a row is invisible to its true owner while still joined by
//! key to their plan. The value is read off the revision row this repository
//! resolved, and `scope_with_model` checks it against the caller's scope on the
//! way in.
//!
//! **The delete precedes the insert inside one transaction**, and the read
//! precedes the delete. `pricing_plan_phase` refuses INSERT, UPDATE *and*
//! DELETE against a non-draft parent revision, and its refusal is a raw driver
//! error carrying no state: the read is there so a caller aiming at a frozen
//! revision is told which conjunct failed before any statement reaches the child
//! table. It is not the guard — the compare-and-swap is — and losing the row to
//! a concurrent publish in the window between them rolls the whole transaction
//! back, deleted phases and all.
//!
//! **A conflict edge is stored on both of its ends, and this is where that is
//! made true** (D-16, §6: "conflicts stored normalized symmetric"). The
//! submitted set is closed under symmetry on the way in: if rule A conflicts
//! with B and B is a member of the same submitted set, B's stored conflict set
//! names A. Leaving it to a caller was rejected — an asymmetric pair is a
//! conflict that exists when read from one side and not from the other, so
//! `AddonConflictBothRequired` would reach two verdicts on one plan depending on
//! which row it started from, and which verdict an author saw would depend on
//! the read order. An edge naming a **non-member** is left exactly as authored:
//! there is no row for the back-edge to land on, and that edge is precisely what
//! `ADDON_INCOMPATIBLE` exists to report — and what bounds the closure to the
//! set is the **row set itself**, since a back-edge computed for an id no
//! submitted rule carries has no row to be written on. `depends_on` is
//! **directed** and is never symmetrized — the reverse edge would make every
//! dependency its own two-cycle and `ADDON_CYCLE` would fail every plan that has
//! one.
//!
//! **Ten functions here are not part of the repository's surface** — a
//! `copy_` and a `delete_` per table — and they exist because D-83 and D-145 are
//! `PlanRepo`'s obligations discharged against these tables: [`copy_phases`] /
//! [`copy_addon_rules`] / [`copy_descriptor_set`] / [`copy_composites`] /
//! [`copy_period_floor_caps`] write the current revision's rows again under a
//! newly opened one with their ids unchanged, and [`delete_phases`] /
//! [`delete_addon_rules`] / [`delete_descriptor_set`] / [`delete_composites`] /
//! [`delete_period_floor_caps`] drop a discarded revision's copies before its row
//! is flipped `abandoned`. **This paragraph is the statement of that obligation**,
//! so a table added without extending it leaves the next author reading a roster
//! that is short by one — which is how the count above stood at three tables and
//! six functions while five tables and eight functions existed. They live beside their table's other statements rather
//! than in `plan_repo.rs` so that every write to a child table is in one file,
//! and they take a runner rather than a connection because each is half of a
//! transaction its caller owns.
