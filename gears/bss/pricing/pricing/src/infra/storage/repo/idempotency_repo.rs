//! The at-most-once gate over `pricing_idempotency_dedup`, and the source a
//! replay is answered from (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7, §4.2 step 1,
//! `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-fr-mutation-idempotency`).
//!
//! **The gate is the insert, not a lookup.** [`claim`] writes the claim row with
//! an `INSERT... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and reads back only when the conflict
//! actually fired. A read-then-write would admit *both* of two concurrent
//! requests carrying the same client key, which is the single situation a client
//! idempotency key exists for: between the read and the write nothing holds the
//! key, so both callers see it free. The conflict is recognized as the driver's
//! typed `DbErr::RecordNotInserted` rather than by matching an error message —
//! message matching makes the gate a string comparison against a backend's
//! wording, and it fails open the first time that wording changes.
//!
//! **`claim` and `record_response` MUST run inside the same transaction as the
//! mutation they guard.** That is why both take a transaction handle instead of
//! a connection, and it is the contract everything below rests on. Under it a
//! losing duplicate's insert blocks on the winner's uncommitted row and, once
//! released, either sees the committed response and replays it, or finds nothing
//! left to conflict with — the winner having rolled back — and claims the key
//! itself. Split across two transactions the guarantee inverts: the claim
//! commits while the mutation does not, and every retry of a request that never
//! happened is answered "already done", forever.
//!
//! **A mismatching hash is refused before the stored response is even looked
//! at.** The same key arriving with a different payload is a mismatch whether or
//! not the first request has finished, so
//! [`RepoError::IdempotencyPayloadMismatch`] does not wait on the answer: there
//! is no state of the first request that makes replaying somebody else's
//! response to this one correct. Such a request is never replayed and never
//! re-executed.
//!
//! **Expiry is evaluated at claim time, which is what makes the TTL real.** A
//! conflicting row older than the configured window is taken over rather than
//! honoured — the key was forgotten when it expired, so nothing about it can be
//! replayed or contradicted, and a takeover is simply the fresh claim it is
//! entitled to. Doing it here rather than in a sweeper means the window holds on
//! the very first request past it, with no reaper running, no reaper lag, and no
//! silent extension of the window when a reaper is down. Reclaiming the storage
//! an expired row occupies is a separate concern and is not implemented here.
//!
//! **A duplicate meeting an unanswered claim is a refusal, and it has a code.**
//! [`RepoError::IdempotencyKeyInFlight`] answers it, because the only
//! alternative is to hand a caller a response nobody ever produced. Two paths
//! reach it, and they are not equally likely:
//!
//! - *Meeting an unanswered fresh claim.* Unreachable under the one-transaction
//!   contract: the transaction holding that claim has not committed, so the
//!   duplicate's insert is still blocked on it and, when released, sees either
//!   the committed response or nothing left to conflict with. Reaching it here
//!   means the contract was violated, and refusing is how that violation
//!   becomes visible instead of becoming a fabricated reply.
//! - *Losing a takeover race.* **Reachable in production, with no contract
//!   violation by anyone.** Nothing holds an expired row between a transaction's
//!   conflict check and its takeover UPDATE, so two duplicates arriving on the
//!   same expired key can both clear the conflict check and both read the same
//!   expired row. The compare-and-swap in [`take_over`] decides; the loser is
//!   refused. Note that the loser may be carrying a **different** payload from
//!   the winner — on this one path a mismatching request is refused in-flight
//!   rather than for the mismatch. At-most-once is intact either way, because
//!   the loser does not execute.
//!
//! D-143 names the case — `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_IN_FLIGHT` (409), *this key is claimed
//! and not yet answered; retry, and you will receive either the stored response or
//! `IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH`* — so the refusal is an answer rather than an
//! outcome the surface has to decide about, and it is shaped like the mismatch
//! beside it: an `Err`, because the guarded mutation must not run and the caller has
//! something to do about it. The gap it closes is **live** and no tightening of the
//! transaction contract closes it, the second path being what keeps it open.
//!
//! [`take_over`]: take_over
//!
//! [`claim`]: IdempotencyGate::claim
//! [`record_response`]: IdempotencyGate::record_response
