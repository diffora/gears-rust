//! The writer of `pricing_catalog_version_ref` — the pending handle a publish
//! commit leaves behind, and the subject the projector will resolve it to.
//!
//! Runner-taking and stateless, like [`audit_repo`](super::audit_repo) and
//! [`outbox_repo`](super::outbox_repo), and for the sharpest version of their
//! reason: a ref recorded outside the publish transaction is either a pending
//! assignment for a publish that never happened — which trips
//! `pricing.catalogversion.commit_overdue` forever — or a publish whose
//! addressability nothing is tracking.
//!
//! # The subject linkage
//!
//! `pricing_catalog_version_ref` is `(tenant_id, pending_ref, subject_kind,
//! subject_ref, catalog_version, requested_at, committed_at)`, and the two
//! subject columns were added by an in-place amendment to
//! `m20260802_000004` while building this path. The migration's own doc carries
//! the argument and the rejected alternative; what matters here is the shape of
//! the obligation. The projector arrives at `CatalogVersionPublished` holding
//! committed refs and must write **exactly the subjects of the publish units
//! that produced** each version (§4.4, D-86/D-91). This row is the only durable
//! answer to "which subject did this handle publish".
//!
//! [`PendingVersionRow::for_subject`] derives both columns from one
//! [`SubjectRef`], so a writer cannot produce a kind and a reference that
//! disagree — `SubjectRef` already makes an `overlay_index` reference
//! inseparable from its shard key, and this constructor is what carries that
//! property into storage.
//!
//! # The finalize, and the one answer it refuses
//!
//! [`finalize`] is a compare-and-swap whose predicate is `catalog_version IS
//! NULL`, so two sweeps resolving one handle cannot both win. Zero rows
//! affected is **not** silently fine: the row is re-read, and the two cases
//! that produce it are answered differently. Already committed at the **same**
//! version is the idempotent replay a re-drive is entitled to make and returns
//! `Ok`. Already committed at a **different** version means the registry
//! answered one handle two ways — which re-points a pin that posted periods
//! resolve through — and is refused as [`RepoError::CorruptRow`], whose doc
//! already says "an invariant breach, never a caller mistake". No new variant
//! and no wire code: this path has no client to report to.
//!
//! It is the storage-side sibling of
//! [`VersionRef::finalize`](crate::domain::snapshot::VersionRef::finalize),
//! which refuses a re-finalize in the domain for the same reason and in the
//! same words. The two are not one mechanism and cannot be: that one moves a
//! value a caller holds, this one moves a row several sweeps can reach, and the
//! guarantee here has to be a predicate on a statement.
//!
//! # The prefix D-114 speaks of is **this tenant's**, and that is a reading
//!
//! [`next_committed_version_after`] answers "the smallest committed version of
//! this tenant strictly above the frontier". D-114 says pin-eligibility
//! requires "every **earlier version** to be itself pin-eligible", and
//! `CatalogVersion` is minted by a **cross-tenant** registry — so a tenant's
//! committed versions are a *subset* of the global sequence and are not
//! contiguous. On the global reading no tenant could ever advance past a
//! version another tenant's publish consumed, and every frontier in the
//! deployment would stick at the first gap. `pricing_pin_frontier` is keyed
//! `tenant_id` alone, which settles which reading was meant.
//!
//! **The ambiguity is reported**; what is implemented is the only buildable
//! reading — every earlier version *this tenant has a ref for*.
//!
//! # What is deliberately absent, and whose it is
//!
//! - **The overdue query.** `pricing.catalogversion.commit_overdue` measures the
//!   age of a pending ref, and [`list_pending_for_tenant`] carries `requested_at`
//!   so the sweep can evaluate that itself. A second query returning "the overdue
//!   ones" would put the threshold — a config value — inside a SQL predicate,
//!   where the job that owns the threshold cannot see it.
//! - **A per-plan read for the publish status API.** §3.6 says a pending ref
//!   "surfaces on the publish status API" — and there is no such path anywhere
//!   in the design set: no slice §5 table declares one, and the publish endpoint
//!   it would accompany cannot be built until Slice 5 supplies an approval
//!   record (see `module::PricingRuntime::publish`). So the debt is **not** a
//!   surface group's; it belongs to whoever lands the publish plane, and minting
//!   a path no table declares would be inventing surface — the same discipline
//!   as inventing a code. `find` therefore still has no caller outside the
//!   commit and the sweep, which is the honest state and not an oversight.

/// pinned at `V` would enumerate an overlay whose document has no delta at or
/// below `V`. That is permanent: a delta is INSERT-only on the seven-year
/// horizon.
///
/// **The greatest ref, not any ref.** An overlay that published revisions 0 and 1
/// has two refs, and at a `V` between them the shard must speak of revision 0 —
/// which is Foundation §4.4's own greatest-completed-≤-pin rule, applied to

/// resolves. It also gives D-133's "two shards when a revision moves the scope
/// value" with no special case: the overlay appears in whichever shard its
/// greatest-≤-`V` revision names, so it leaves the old shard and joins the new
/// one at the version that moved it.
///
/// **Committed refs only.** A pending ref carries no version, so it belongs to no
/// `V` yet; the caller adds the refs of the version it is *currently* projecting,
/// which is the same union [`version_subjects`](crate::infra::read_model) makes
/// and for the same reason — those rows are not finalized yet and this query
/// cannot see them.
///
/// # The `<= V` bound is the correct rule and **nothing currently exercises it**
///
/// Stated as a premise rather than left to be assumed, because a probe found it:
/// removing the bound entirely reddens no test. What keeps a *later* version's
/// overlays out of this set today is not the bound but the `IS NOT NULL` filter
/// beside it — a version is projected while every later version's refs are still
/// **pending**, since the sweep groups by version and walks them ascending. And a
/// version cannot normally be projected *after* a later one has committed either:
/// D-114's prefix closure means the frontier would already have passed it, and
/// [`refuse_projection_below_frontier`](crate::infra::read_model) refuses that
/// loudly.
///
/// So the bound is defence rather than the load-bearing guard, and it stays for
/// the reason it is written: it says what the rule *is*. The two mechanisms that
/// enforce it today are incidental to this query, and a change to either — a
/// sweep that projected versions out of order, a re-drive reaching a version
/// below a committed sibling — would make this bound the only thing standing
/// between a frozen shard and an overlay from the future.
