//! Repository for a `PriceOverlay` and its revision chain — `pricing_price_overlay`
//! plus the two child tables that version with it (`design/09-price-overlays.md`
//! §6, D-42, D-92, D-107).
//!
//! # The overlay carries its own revision chain, unlike a bundle
//!
//! [`bundle_repo`](super::bundle_repo)'s composition rides the **plan's**
//! revisions and takes the plan revision's entity tag. An overlay has no plan:
//! it is a separate object evaluated downstream, and D-92 gives it a chain of
//! its own keyed `(price_overlay_id, revision)`. So this repository owns the
//! whole discipline rather than borrowing one — the open, the copy forward, the
//! compare-and-swap and the publish flip are all here.
//!
//! # The line set is replaced wholesale, never merged
//!
//! Every D-42 rule is a property of the **set** — "≥ 1 line", the duplicate-key
//! rule, the most-specific resolution, the per-currency coverage walk — and a
//! partial update leaves no set the rules could evaluate. It is `PriceRepo`'s
//! band precedent and `BundleRepo`'s composition precedent, for the reason both
//! give.
//!
//! # The copy forward preserves `line_id`, which is the whole of D-92's clause
//!
//! [`OverlayRepo::open_revision`] copies each line onto the successor revision
//! **under its own id**. That is what *"copy-on-new-revision with stable line
//! identity where unchanged"* means, and it is only expressible because the
//! line's key is `(line_id, overlay_revision)` — see `m20260802_000033`'s module
//! doc for why §6's literal `PK line_id` is not buildable beside that clause.
//!
//! # The publish is one commit, and it has to be
//!
//! §6: *"the submit/commit publishes that revision and flips its predecessor
//! `published -> superseded` **in the same commit**"*. Two commits would leave a
//! window in which the overlay has two published revisions — which the partial
//! precedence index would refuse outright, so the intermediate state is not
//! merely wrong but unreachable. [`OverlayRepo::publish_revision`] does both
//! inside one transaction.
//!
//! **The predecessor is superseded first, and the order matters more than the
//! index argument suggests.** Measured by reversing it: eight cases redden, not
//! the one about superseding. The predecessor is found *by state* — the
//! published revision of this overlay — so a lookup made after the successor's
//! flip finds **the row just published** and supersedes it, leaving the overlay
//! with no published revision at all. The partial index is the second reason;
//! the first is that the query has no way to tell the two apart once both are
//! `published`.
//!
//! # All four mutations write an audit record, on the overlay's own chain
//!
//! D-14 and `inst-rb-audit`: [`record_overlay_mutation`] appends to
//! `pricing_audit_log` **inside** each mutation's transaction, because a record
//! that could commit separately from the mutation it describes is evidence of
//! something that may not have happened.
//!
//! The chain is [`audit_repo::overlay_chain`] and not any plan's. D-135 keys a
//! segment on the audited subject's *aggregate*; S5 §6 lists an overlay as one in
//! its own right, and it has to be, because an overlay is not a plan and has no
//! plan — borrowing `PlanRevision` would put two aggregates on one hash chain,
//! which then verifies perfectly while telling an auditor something false. An
//! overlay's lines may target several plans or none at all
//! ([`LineKey::list_default`]), so there is not even a well-defined plan to
//! borrow.
//!
//! **This section said the opposite until 2026-08-06, and the account it gave of
//! why was accurate**: `AuditSubjectKind` had no overlay member, adding one made
//! two exhaustive `match`es non-exhaustive, and one of those is in
//! `infra::approval`, a file the strand that built this repository was fenced out
//! of. So the four sites carried their [`AuditStamp`] to a `let _ = stamp;` and
//! the plane wrote nothing at all — a plain regression against D-14 on an
//! always-material subject, reported as the overlay register's **O-3** and paid at
//! the merge.
//!
//! What the register sized as *"an addition at four call sites, not a signature
//! sweep"* was that plus one more thing it did not see: `AuditSubjectKind::ALL`
//! drives `sqlite_approval_repo::every_subject_kind_d158_declares_is_storable_on_the_mirror`,
//! so a fifth member obliges `chk_pricing_approval_subject_kind` to admit it —
//! D-158's *"extended together"*, arriving as `m20260802_000035` and a `SQLite`
//! table rebuild.
//!
//! # What the store answers and what the pipeline answers
//!
//! Two of §5's overlay codes are typed **409** rather than as architectural
//! 422s: `PRECEDENCE_DUPLICATE` and `OVERLAY_INTERVAL_OVERLAP`. Both have a
//! *checking* half in [`crate::domain::overlay_rules`], which puts them in the
//! one-pass report an author remediates from, and `PRECEDENCE_DUPLICATE` has a
//! *constraint* half here — `uq_pricing_price_overlay_precedence`, which is what
//! catches two submits that both read a free slot before either wrote. The two
//! halves answer the same code and the same remedy, which is
//! [`RepoError::PendingKeyHeld`]'s arrangement one plane over.

/// between the two, and a failure to write it rolls the mutation back rather than
/// leaving a trail that is silently incomplete. `plan_repo::record_revision_mutation`
/// is the same arrangement one plane over.
///
/// The chain is [`audit_repo::overlay_chain`] and **not** the target plan's, for the
/// reason D-135 gives: a segment is keyed on the audited subject's *aggregate*, and
/// S5 §6 lists an overlay as one in its own right. An overlay's lines may target
/// several plans, or none — `LineKey::list_default` — so there is not even a
/// well-defined plan to borrow.
///
/// `before_state` is `None` throughout, and that is a statement rather than a
/// shortcut: three of the four mutations create a row (the overlay, its successor
/// revision, its replacement line set) and have no before, and `publish_revision`'s
/// predecessor state is derivable from the record one `seq` back on the same chain.
/// Recording a before that the writer had to re-read would be a second answer to a
/// question the chain already answers.
///
/// # The subject is [`audit_repo::overlay_revision_ref`], and used to be a bare id
///
/// Z8-6. That helper's own doc calls itself *"one overlay revision's durable **audit
/// and approval** name"*, and it reached one of the two stores: `infra::approval`
/// and `infra::overlay_publish` call it, and this writer — the only one on the audit
/// side — hand-wrote `price_overlay_id.to_string()`. So the record of an act and the
/// unit authorizing it named one subject two different ways, and `subject_ref` is
/// the only join between the planes: a walk over it found nothing. The revision was
/// not *lost* — it rides in `after_state` — but a value in a payload is not a name,
/// and only the name is joinable.
///
/// The correction is `window_ref`'s, applied rather than reinvented: that helper
/// records the same divergence for windows and states the rule — *"it keeps both
/// stores on one spelling: the audit record and the approval record of one act name
/// it identically, which is the alignment D-158 is about, and it is why the helper
/// moved rather than its three call sites."* Here too the call sites do not move;
/// they already pass the revision they acted on, which is why each of the four
/// records now names its own rather than sharing one.
///
/// **Not vocabulary.** What the design set declares is the `subject_kind` token
/// (S5 §6), and `AuditSubjectKind::Overlay` is unchanged — no roster, `CHECK` or
/// enum moves with this. How a subject of that kind is *spelled* is the store's
