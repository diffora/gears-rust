//! Reads and writes of `pricing_price_window` behind the tenant gate
//! (`design/07-pricewindow-linkage.md` §6).
//!
//! Free functions taking a **runner** rather than a provider, for
//! [`approval_repo`](super::approval_repo)'s reason and one of this store's own.
//! D-99 makes every window mutation a publish unit — validation, a pending
//! `CatalogVersion` ref, a plan-subject re-projection and an outbox row — so a
//! window row that could commit separately from that unit would advertise
//! coverage no consumer's read model has, which is precisely the trailing void
//! D-62 → D-80 → D-94 closed. And [`refuse_overlap`] below has to run inside the
//! same transaction as the insert it guards; a repository holding a provider
//! could not join one, `Db::conn()` being refused outright inside an open
//! transaction.
//!
//! # Non-overlap is here, no **declarative** constraint could hold it, and a
//! trigger could
//!
//! §6: *"non-overlap per canonical scope key enforced **inside every
//! mutation**"*. That is not a stylistic choice and this module is not where a
//! constraint was skipped. The canonical scope key is ten columns of
//! `pricing_price`; `pricing_price_window` carries `price_id` and none of the
//! eight. So no `UNIQUE` index can state the rule, no partial-index predicate can
//! (a predicate sees only its own row's columns — neither the parent's key nor a
//! sibling window's interval), and a range exclusion constraint would need
//! `btree_gist` on Postgres, would still be per-`price_id` rather than per-key,
//! and has no `SQLite` expression at all.
//!
//! **What is *not* true is that the rule could not live in the schema at all.** A
//! cross-table trigger could carry it, and this chain already has one —
//! `pricing_price_tier_band_parent_kind` (`m20260802_000011`) reads its parent row
//! to decide. Not building a second procedural spelling of the key resolution,
//! the occupying-state set and the half-open arithmetic below is a **choice with a
//! residue**, not an impossibility, and the residue is that non-overlap is the one
//! invariant of this table guarded at a single layer where every other is guarded
//! at two.
//!
//! §6's two clauses are two rules and not two readings of one. "REVOKE +
//! column-whitelist trigger discipline" governs **historical immutability**, and
//! it is implemented — as the portable half, per the migration's own note.
//! "Inside every mutation" governs **non-overlap**, and it is implemented here.
//! There is no contradiction between them to resolve; an earlier revision of this
//! doc claimed one, and that claim was invented.
//!
//! The interval is half-open, so [`intersects`] is
//! `a.from < b.to_or_infinity && b.from < a.to_or_infinity` and
//! `effective_to = next.effective_from` does **not** intersect. Adjacency is legal
//! and §9 names it as the false positive this arithmetic must not produce.
//!
//! # What the state machine says here, and how many times it is said
//!
//! Three times, and that is the same arrangement `approval_repo` argues for.
//! [`WindowState::may_move_to`] is the statement;
//! [`transition`]'s `UPDATE` carries its own `state = <expected>` predicate, so a
//! flip that lost a race matches no row rather than trusting the read that
//! preceded it; and `trg_pricing_price_window_append_only` is what an ad-hoc
//! `UPDATE` meets. None of the three is redundant, because each is what a
//! different caller reaches.
//!
//! §4's edges are **conditional**, and the conditions are said in the same three
//! places. `inst-ws-activate` fires WHEN `now ≥ effectiveFrom`, `inst-ws-expire`
//! WHEN `now ≥ effectiveTo`, and *"an open-ended window never expires"*.
//! [`WindowInterval::has_started`] and [`WindowInterval::is_due_to_expire`] are
//! the statement — the domain's, consulted rather than restated;
//! [`transition`]'s `UPDATE` carries them **into its `WHERE`** beside the state
//! predicate; and `chk_pricing_price_window_activation_order`,
//! `chk_pricing_price_window_expiry_order` and
//! `chk_pricing_price_window_open_ended` are the row-local half a CHECK can hold.
//! Until 2026-08-04 the conditions were in none of the three, and
//! [`transition`] would activate a window a week before its start and expire an
//! open-ended one on request.
//!
//! # What this module refuses, what it does not, and the line between them
//!
//! The criterion is [`crate::domain::window`]'s: **the store answers what it also
//! enforces physically, and a surface answers what only a request can be judged
//! against.** Both halves cost something, so both are written out.
//!
//! Refused here, each by consulting the domain's own predicate rather than by
//! restating a rule:
//!
//! * **non-overlap per canonical scope key** (`WINDOW_OVERLAP`) — §6's, and this
//!   module is its only producer anywhere;
//! * **`inst-ws-immutable`** (`WINDOW_HISTORICAL_IMMUTABLE`) — a terminal window's
//!   `effective_to`, an end that has already passed, and an end moved *to* a past
//!   instant. Arms 2 and 5 of `trg_pricing_price_window_append_only` are the same
//!   rule physically, which is what makes it the store's to answer; before the
//!   pre-check a caller met the trigger and read a **500** for a request whose
//!   whole remedy is a later instant;
//! * **the interval's non-emptiness** — `chk_pricing_price_window_interval`'s
//!   application half, [`RepoError::WindowIntervalEmpty`], for the same reason: a
//!   CHECK is not an answer a caller can act on.
//!
//! Not refused here, and each somebody else's by ownership rather than by
//! omission:
//!
//! * `inst-ws-future-start` (`WINDOW_START_IN_PAST`) — a start strictly in the
//!   future at creation. It compares against the instant a **request** arrived,
//!   which no row carries and no trigger can see, so
//!   [`crate::domain::window::check_creation`] owns it whole. A consequence worth
//!   stating: this store will accept a window whose start is already behind the
//!   caller's own clock, and the fixtures and the activation-job suites depend on
//!   exactly that to seed a window that is due.
//! * `inst-ws-cancel`'s `WINDOW_NOT_CANCELLABLE` — also about the request, namely
//!   *which operation* was asked for, which a generic [`transition`] cannot see.
//!   [`crate::domain::window::check_cancellation`] owns it. What arrives here from
//!   an unsanctioned edge is [`RepoError::WindowStateForbidden`], which mints no
//!   code; that variant's doc says why.
//! * The coverage refusals — `WINDOW_COVERAGE_MISSING`, `WINDOW_GAP`,
//!   `WINDOW_TRAILING_VOID` **and `AVAILABILITY_OUTSIDE_COVERAGE`**, which §5
//!   declares and this roster used to omit. Each ranges over every window of a key;
//!   one of them, `WINDOW_TRAILING_VOID`, additionally needs the D-79 subscriber
//!   lane, `inst-fg-trailing`'s only exemption being about in-flight subscribers.
//!   `CoverageChecker`'s.
//! * **D-04's grandfathering horizon, which §6 names this function.** §6: a
//!   grandfathered generation's window `effective_to` MUST stay
//!   `≥ grandfather_until + the longest billing cycle sold on the key`, *"enforced
//!   at cutover and on every `effectiveTo` adjustment"*. [`adjust_effective_to`]
//!   **is** that second half and does not enforce it, which is a live gap rather
//!   than a phase-5 one: `pricing_price.grandfather_until` is already a written
//!   column with its own CHECK, so a key can carry a horizon today and a shorten
//!   can walk its coverage inside it today. It is not enforced here because the
//!   rule's second input has no producer anywhere in this crate — "the longest
//!   billing cycle sold on the key" is W6's, and a search for it finds only prose
//!   (`crate::infra::read_model`'s horizon note, `crate::domain::window`'s D-80
//!   note): no function, no column, no type. Enforcing it against a guessed cycle
//!   would be worse than not enforcing it, because the guess would be the number a
//!   money horizon was checked against. **This is the entry the deferred list was
//!   missing**, and it is owed along one chain rather than to one group:
//!   **G3 builds the cycle set** (it owns `CoverageChecker` and the D-80 horizon, the
//!   same term under another margin), **G4 wires it into [`adjust_effective_to`]**
//!   (§6 requires the bound on every `effectiveTo` adjustment, and G4 owns this path
//!   and the routes that reach it), and **G5 consumes it in sellability predicate
//!   (1)**. [`crate::infra::read_model`]'s horizon note states the same chain, which
//!   it did not before 2026-08-04: it named G5 as the builder while this entry named
//!   G3, two documents in one group's diff naming two owners for one owed input.
//!   Beware the name: W6 is *called* "the longest billing cycle sold on the key" and
//!   is *defined* per **plan** — the longest `frequency` among the plan's recurring
//!   rows on the key's `(currency, region)` — and is **zero** on a plan with no
//!   recurring part. The cutover half is phase 5's and has no code to be absent from.
//!
//! # The [`AuditStamp`] is taken and the trail is **not** written here
//!
//! Every mutating call takes a stamp, because there is no unaudited entry point in
//! this crate by design. [`schedule`] consumes it: the scheduler **is** the actor
//! of the row and the submission instant **is** the row's instant, so `created_by`
//! and `created_at` come off the stamp rather than off two more fields that could
//! disagree with the record of the same act.
//!
//! `pricing_audit_log` gets nothing yet. The deferral is the phase plan's and is
//! kept, but the mechanism first written here was wrong and is corrected:
//! **`pricing_audit_log.subject_kind` is free `text` with no CHECK at all**
//! (`m20260802_000010`, and `tests/postgres_migrations.rs`'s roster confirms it —
//! the only audit CHECKs are `entry_kind`, `rollup` and `seq`). So writing a
//! `window`-subject audit row would trip no constraint and would **not** break
//! D-158 in the schema. What binds the token is the plan's discipline plus
//! [`AuditSubjectKind`]'s Rust enumeration, which is paired with
//! `chk_pricing_approval_subject_kind` — the **approval** table's CHECK — and that
//! pairing is what must not be extended before a writer exists.
//!
//! **The sharper debt is not the audit row, and it is not deferrable by a
//! signature.** [`adjust_effective_to`] is an always-material operator act (D-62:
//! a shorten is always material) and it records **no actor anywhere**:
//! `created_by` is frozen by the whitelist, this table has no `updated_by`, and no
//! audit row is written. So the store holds who *scheduled* a window and cannot
//! answer who *shortened* it — including who moved a money-bearing coverage end.
//! That is a missing column, not a missing INSERT, and it is reported rather than
//! patched: a column no decision names is not this group's to mint.
//!
//! [`transition`]'s parameter is spelled `_stamp` because that path uses none of
//! it, so the omission is visible at every call site instead of being a promise
//! the signature makes and the body does not keep. [`adjust_effective_to`] does
//! read it — `recorded_at` is the clock `inst-ws-immutable` is judged against
//! there — and still writes no record, which is the same debt with one fewer
//! marker on it.

/// # The predicate is the whole of the sweep's selection, and all three parts

///
/// `state = <the boundary's from-state>`, the boundary instant `<= at`, and the
/// **price row's lifecycle state** — §4's edge, §4's condition, and D-121's row
/// set. None is redundant with the store's own guards and none with the others:
///
/// * the **state** half is what keeps history out, and it keeps a *permanently
///   false alarm* out as well as a failed attempt. A `cancelled` window whose
///   start has passed satisfies the instant half forever, and handing it to
///   [`transition`] as an activation would be refused there — so without this
///   half a pass reports one failure per cancelled window per tick. It would also
///   count every such window `overdue`, because the overdue condition is read off
///   the due set: `pricing.window.activation_overdue` — the Warn that means the
///   lease singleton is **stalled** — would fire on settled history, on every
///   tick, forever. A failure counter and a permanently false alarm are not the
///   same stake, and removing this half moves both: most of the sweep's suite
///   reddens, and most of those reports gain an `overdue` beside the `failed`
///   (`an_open_ended_window_never_expires` goes from reporting nothing at all to
///   `{windows_due: 1, failed: 1, overdue: 1}`, which is the clearest single case).
/// * the **instant** half is the only thing bounding the sweep to windows whose
///   time has come. [`transition`]'s own `effective_from <= at` cannot stand in
///   for it: `at` is the instant §4 puts the transition at, so a caller that
///   selected a window starting next year and passed that start as `at` would
///   satisfy the store's predicate trivially. The store's clause guards the race
///   between a read and a write; this one guards the selection.
/// * the **lifecycle** half puts the sweep on the **published** side, and it is
///   the one part of this predicate that is about the parent row rather than the
///   window. It is a subquery over `pricing_price` rather than a filter applied
///   after the page, so a row that can never flip cannot consume the page either
///   — see the paging note below, and `projected_price_rows`.
///
/// `effective_to IS NOT NULL` rides with the expiry half rather than being a
/// fourth rule: *"an open-ended window never expires"* (`inst-ws-expire`), and
/// on this read it is also what makes [`DueWindow::at`] constructible.
///
/// # Why the sweep is draft-**exclusive** where the overlap check is
/// draft-inclusive
///
/// The two are different kinds of question and the distinction is written here
/// because its absence is how the opposite behaviour arrived — inherited by
/// default and never argued.
///
/// * The **overlap check** and the coverage-at-publish check are *validation over
///   a hypothetical*: "if this row were current on this key, would the interval
///   set be sound?" A draft row's windows have to be in that comparison, because
///   `inst-wc-required` fails a publish whose key has no covering window, so
///   coverage is authored **before** the row publishes.
///   `price_repo::load_scope_keys_for_plan` states that as substance rather than
///   omission and it is untouched; this read does not use it.
/// * The **projection** and this **sweep** are *assertion of fact to a consumer*.
///   `PriceWindowActivated` states that a price took effect; a draft row is
///   addressable at no `CatalogVersion` and resolvable by no pin, so there is no
///   consumer for whom that could be true. And the sweep's only reader —
///   `read_model::project_windows` — restricts to [`PROJECTED_ROW_STATES`] by
///   `price_id`, so this is not a seam between two consumers but a producer that
///   would otherwise disagree with its single reader.
///
/// **The sharpest form is not the false event but the state loss.** `expired` is
/// terminal ([`WindowState::may_move_to`] has no edge back to `scheduled` or
/// `active`), so a sweep that flipped a draft row's windows would drive any window
/// whose interval passed while its row was unpublished to terminal `expired` —
/// permanently losing its ability to ever take effect, and needing nothing more
/// exotic than a draft that publishes later than its own window's end.
///
/// ## What that costs, stated rather than left to be discovered
///
/// * **Windows on a `draft` row never flip.** `PROJECTED_ROW_STATES` is
///   `{published, superseded}` and `chk_pricing_price_lifecycle_state` admits
///   exactly `draft | published | superseded`, so `draft` is the whole of the
///   excluded set on this table. ([`LifecycleState`](crate::domain::lifecycle::LifecycleState)
///   has five variants, but `abandoned` and `retired` are plan-revision states the
///   price row's CHECK does not admit — so there is no such thing as a retired
///   price row for a window to be stranded on.)
/// * **A frozen `scheduled` window keeps occupying its canonical scope key**,
///   [`OCCUPYING_STATES`] including `scheduled`. That is bounded and it is the
///   right direction: the overlap read is per plan, a row that publishes flips on
///   the very next tick — late, and *visibly* late through the overdue alarm the
///   pass raises — and a discarded draft self-cleans, because `abandoned` is not a
///   price-row state and draft price rows stay deletable. A visible refusal beats
///   a durable false assertion.
/// * **No data repair is owed.** Nothing drains `pricing_outbox` in this
///   repository (`published_at` is NULL and stays NULL, and the relay does not
///   exist), so no false event has reached a consumer.
///
/// `limit` bounds the page, and a full page is a fact the caller **does** act on:
/// the sweep spends one budget across both boundaries and reads expiries first, so
/// a saturated expiry page leaves an activation read no room at all
/// (`jobs::window_activation`'s `activation_budget` states why). There are then due
/// windows this pass did not see, and the next pass takes them with their
/// boundaries older, which is what the overdue alarm is measured on.
/// Ordered by the boundary instant then `window_id`: the boundary because a
/// backlog must drain in the order it accumulated, and the id because two
/// windows legitimately share a boundary (a changeover, adjacency) and a tie
/// broken by the storage engine would page differently on each read.

/// This is what an activation sweep needs from a store, and the reason it is a
/// `WHERE` rather than only a pre-check: with the condition in the statement a
/// second pass over the same instant matches **zero rows** and needs no marker
/// column, and a concurrent writer cannot step between the read and the write.
/// A scan-then-flip built on the pre-check alone would be a race.
///
/// `at` remains a separate argument from `stamp.recorded_at` because the two are
/// still not one fact: the sweep instant is when the flip was *recorded*, `at` is
/// where §4 puts the transition, and a job running behind its SLO makes the

///
/// * **There is no way to issue `pg_advisory_xact_lock` from here.** This function
///   holds `&impl DBRunner`, and `DBRunner`'s only supertrait — `DBRunnerInternal`,
///   which carries the single method that yields a `SeaOrm` connection — is
///   **private at `toolkit_db::secure`'s re-export boundary**. Naming it from this
///   crate is `error[E0603]: trait DBRunnerInternal is private`. So no raw statement
///   of any kind can be executed through a runner, advisory lock or otherwise.
/// * **`toolkit-db`'s advisory locks are not DB-native.**
///   `libs/toolkit-db/src/advisory_locks.rs` states it in as many words: they "are
///   implemented **purely as file-based locks** (no DB-native advisory locks)". They
///   are per **host**, so two pods do not contend on them at all — and they hang off
///   `Db`, not off a transaction, so they are not transaction-scoped either. Reaching
///   for `Db::lock` here would produce a guard that looks like the fix and serializes
///   nothing across a deployment.
/// * **`SecureSelect` exposes no row locking.** There is no `lock_exclusive`, no
///   `lock_shared` and no `FOR UPDATE` anywhere in `toolkit_db::secure`, so the
///   sibling read cannot be taken under a lock either.
///
/// A constraint is out for its own reason, which the module doc already gives and
/// which G4 did not change: the canonical scope key is ten columns of
/// `pricing_price` and **none of them is on the window row**, so no unique index
/// reaches it; a Postgres exclusion constraint would additionally need `btree_gist`
/// *and* the key denormalised onto this table, and `SQLite` has no exclusion
/// constraints at all.
///
/// # So the invariant is unserialized, and what it would take is named
///
/// Two routes exist and **both are outside a code group's remit**, which is why this
/// is a recorded hole rather than a deferred task:
///
/// 1. **A `toolkit-db` change** exposing a DB-native, transaction-scoped advisory
///    lock through the runner — `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on Postgres, a no-op on
///    `SQLite`, whose single-writer engine already supplies the ordering. That is a
///    platform library's API surface, not this gear's.
/// 2. **Denormalising the canonical scope key onto `pricing_price_window`** plus a
///    Postgres exclusion constraint over `(scope_key, interval)`. That duplicates the
///    key the design set puts on `pricing_price` (§3.7, ADR-0002) and makes the two
///    copies a thing that can disagree, so it is a data-model decision with a
///    register entry, not a repository edit.
///
/// The hole is **pinned by a test rather than left to a comment**:
/// `tests/postgres_window.rs`'s
/// `two_overlapping_windows_on_one_key_do_not_contend_and_both_commit` asserts the
/// negative — no backend blocks, and both overlapping rows are there. Its reddening

///   key** is what refuses the duplicate event. The lease is not what makes that
