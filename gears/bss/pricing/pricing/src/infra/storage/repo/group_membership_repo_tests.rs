//! [`resolve_active_membership`] at every boundary — no database, on purpose:
//! the rule is arithmetic over a handful of instants, cheaper and clearer to
//! state that way than to seed as rows. `tests/sqlite_group_membership_repo.rs`
//! is where `enroll`/`end_membership`/`intervals_for_payer` are proved through
//! the repository, against a store that has to enforce D-09; this file is
//! where the narrowing rule they feed is proved on its own.
