//! Repository for `pricing_repricing_journal` — the rows a mass-repricing run
//! selected, and how far each got (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §6,
//! `inst-mr-journal`, `inst-mp-journal`; D-261, D-307).
//!
//! # The table had a schema, two behavioural suites and no caller
//!
//! It landed with D-261 and was reachable by nothing: no repository, and the two
//! suites drive raw SQL by design, so they exercised the **table** without
//! exercising any code. This module is its first writer, which is also what turns
//! `trg_pricing_repricing_journal_only_under_a_repricing_run` and
//! `chk_pricing_bulk_operation_import_never_awaits` from rules nothing can
//! violate into rules a production path can.
//!
//! # Every mutation takes the caller's runner
//!
//! Only runner-taking forms, and no method here opens a transaction. That is the
//! opposite of `infra::bulk`'s arrangement and it is D-134's requirement rather
//! than a preference: a repricing run's transaction unit is the **plan** — all of
//! a plan's selected rows commit together with the plan-level aggregate pass
//! inside that transaction — so the journal flip for a row has to land in the same
//! transaction as the successor it records. A method that opened its own would
//! leave a journal saying `applied` beside rows that rolled back.
//!
//! # The state machine is the trigger's
//!
//! `pending → applied | failed`, and a decided row is frozen whole. This module
//! names a target state and writes it, for [`super::bulk_repo`]'s stated reason:
//! a `match` here listing the legal edges would be a second spelling of a rule
//! that already exists on two engines.
//!
//! # Nothing in this chain bounds a run's size, and a caller may not assume otherwise
//!
//! `price_repo::load_published_for_selector` freezes the selector's row set with **no
//! page bound** — its own doc says so, in as many words, under "There is no page
//! bound, and that is a real edge" — [`open_rows`] inserts every row it is handed, and
//! [`list_for_run`]/[`pending_for_run`] read every row of a run back in one `Vec`.
//! Their doc comments used to claim the opposite (that a run's set was "bounded by the
//! page cap"), which was prose with no `.limit(...)` behind it anywhere in this file —
//! disproven by reading the code, confirmed empirically with rows past the crate's
//! own REST hard cap of 1,000 on one run, and it had already misled one reader: the
//! 2026-08-10 review's out-of-scope table repeated the claim
//! (`docs/reviews/2026-08-10-eye-review-findings.md:475`) while pricing a different
//! unbounded read, `load_published_for_selector`. **This is the fact the apply lane
//! has to build
//! against**: a run may be as large as the selector froze, the selector is itself
//! unbounded, and consuming the journal has to be done in bounded batches rather than
//! by assuming this layer already capped it. Whether a cap ever gets imposed is a
//! design decision that belongs with the selector edge, not with this repository.
