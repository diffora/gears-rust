//! Reads and writes of `pricing_group_membership` — the operator-facing half
//! of D-09's non-overlap invariant
//! (`design/09-price-overlays.md` §3 `inst-cg-record` / `inst-cg-resolve`,
//! `inst-mm-audit`, `inst-ms-time`).
//!
//! Free functions taking a **runner** rather than a provider,
//! [`window_repo`](super::window_repo)'s reason and one of this store's own:
//! [`refuse_overlap`] has to run inside the same transaction as the insert it
//! guards, and the audit record every mutation writes (`inst-mm-audit`) has to
//! commit with it — a repository holding a provider could not join either,
//! `Db::conn()` being refused outright inside an open transaction.
//!
//! # The invariant now lives in two layers, deliberately
//!
//! `m20260802_000067`'s module doc states why this table is *not*
//! [`window_repo`]'s situation: the collision domain is `(tenant_id,
//! payer_tenant_id)` — both columns of **this row** — so, unlike the canonical
//! scope key a window's non-overlap is judged against, the declarative form is
//! available here, and the migration carries it physically on both engines (a
//! Postgres `EXCLUDE USING gist`, a paired `SQLite` trigger). That constraint
//! is the **backstop**: it is what a concurrent writer that stepped past this
//! module's own check would still meet, which is exactly the promise
//! [`window_repo::refuse_overlap`]'s doc records that a repository-only guard
//! **cannot** make on its own — "an invariant a concurrent writer can step
//! through is not an invariant". Two layers is not redundancy here; it is what
//! makes the *whole* of D-09 an invariant rather than only its happy path.
//!
//! [`refuse_overlap`] below is the other layer, and it exists for a different
//! reason than correctness: the constraint refuses the row, but a caller who
//! meets it head-on reads a driver's constraint-violation string — a 500, on
//! the shape every other guarded table in this crate takes before its own
//! pre-check lands (`window_repo`'s history-immutability note is the same
//! story one table over). This module reads the payer's existing memberships
//! and answers **by name** — `MEMBERSHIP_OVERLAP` or `MEMBERSHIP_CONFLICT`,
//! §5's own two codes — before the statement that would trip the constraint is
//! even issued.
//!
//! **Where the two disagree the database wins, and this module does not
//! pretend otherwise.** A race that lands between this check's read and its
//! own insert — two concurrent enrollments of one payer, neither's read seeing
//! the other's write — is exactly the shape `window_repo::refuse_overlap`
//! documents as unserializable from this crate with the tools available to it,
//! and that limit is unchanged here: this function holds `&impl DBRunner`, and
//! `toolkit_db`'s advisory locks are file-based (not DB-native) and
//! `SecureSelect` exposes no row locking. What is different from the window
//! plane is the *consequence* of losing that race: there, an unserialized
//! writer could commit an overlapping row outright, because nothing else was
//! watching. Here, the exclusion constraint / trigger this migration wrote is
//! still watching, and the loser's `INSERT` is refused **physically** — the
//! data can never disagree with D-09, only the *message* the loser reads can
//! be worse than this module's own. That message is not parsed back into
//! `MembershipOverlap` / `MembershipConflict` here: neither backend's
//! constraint-violation rendering is this crate's to parse (the Postgres
//! `EXCLUDE` raises SQLSTATE `23P01`, not the unique-violation class
//! `contention_or_db` already recognises, and the `SQLite` trigger's
//! `RAISE(ABORT, …)` carries only a message string), so a race that slips past
//! this pre-check surfaces as [`RepoError::Db`] — a 500 — for that narrow
//! window. That is the same residue `window_repo`'s history-immutability guard
//! left before its own pre-check existed, reported rather than silently
//! assumed away.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not built here
//!
//! **Taxonomy validation.** `GROUP_UNKNOWN` (§5, `inst-cg-taxonomy`'s "values
//! validated at authoring") is not checked in this module: this is the storage
//! layer for the membership plane and it has no dependency on
//! `customer_group_taxonomy`'s own repository arm. A route that authors an
//! enrollment owes that check before calling [`enroll`].
//!
//! **The `If-Match` precondition on `row_version`.** The design set
//! (`window_repo::adjust_effective_to`'s own arrangement, D-191) puts a
//! caller-supplied `expected` version in the `UPDATE`'s own `WHERE` so a
//! concurrent editor cannot win a race the caller's read predates. This
//! module's `end_membership` signature carries no such parameter — an
//! unconditional update, naming a real gap rather than a silent one: two
//! concurrent `PATCH`es of one membership can both succeed, the second
//! overwriting the first's `effective_to` with no conflict raised. The column
//! exists for exactly this (`group_membership::Model::row_version`'s own doc:
//! "an authoring `PATCH` … answers `If-Match` against it"); wiring it is owed
//! to whichever task builds that route.
//!
//! **The atomic move operation** (`inst-ms-move`, D-09: "end the active
//! membership + create the new one at the same instant"). Composing that out
//! of [`enroll`] and [`end_membership`] inside one transaction is a route's
//! job, not this module's; both primitives are transaction-agnostic exactly so
//! a caller can do that.
