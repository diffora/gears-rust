//! The half-open interval arithmetic, the two derivations that hang off the
//! state token, and the `SQLite` half of the schema's own overlap refusal.
//!
//! Almost no database here, on purpose: [`intersects`] is the whole of §6's
//! non-overlap rule reduced to four instants, and the shapes that matter —
//! adjacency, containment, an open-ended end — are cheaper and clearer to state
//! as arithmetic than to seed as rows. `tests/sqlite_window_repo.rs` is where the
//! rule is proved *through the repository*, against the store that has to enforce
//! it.
//!
//! # The exception, and why it cannot live in `tests/`
//!
//! [`overlap_or`] reads a driver **message** — `pricing_price_window`'s constraint
//! name on Postgres, its `RAISE(ABORT)` text on `SQLite` — and answers
//! [`RepoError::WindowOverlap`] where `contention_or_db` would have answered
//! [`RepoError::Db`], which the door renders as a 500. Its Postgres half is
//! pinned behaviourally by `tests/postgres_window.rs`'s two race cases. Its
//! `SQLite` half was pinned only by `tests/sqlite_migrations.rs`'s name-and-digest
//! census, which protects the *migration's* literal and says nothing about the
//! recognizer's: change the string `overlap_or` matches on and every `SQLite`
//! overlap refusal degrades to a 500 with the whole suite green (review F7,
//! 2026-08-21).
//!
//! Closing that needs the two literals compared *through the engine* — a real
//! abort message handed to the real recognizer — and neither end of that is
//! reachable from an integration test. `overlap_or` is private, and its input is a
//! `toolkit_db::secure::ScopeError` no public door hands back: every door maps it
//! before it returns. So the two cases below take a migrated in-memory mirror,
//! write past [`super::schedule`]'s pre-check so that the **trigger** is what
//! answers, and feed the error it produced to the function under test. In-crate
//! database tests have precedent for exactly this reason — see
//! `idempotency_repo_tests`, whose compare-and-swap is likewise unreachable
//! through the public surface.
//!
//! A **race** is what `adjust_effective_to` actually loses on Postgres, and it is
//! deliberately not simulated here: `SQLite` serializes its writers, so a
//! concurrency case on this harness would prove nothing. What is proved here is
//! the pair the race depends on — that the trigger refuses, and that its wording
//! is one the recognizer knows.
