//! `payload_hash`, and the takeover compare-and-swap.
//!
//! Most of this module is a property of a statement and is pinned in
//! `tests/sqlite_idempotency.rs`. Two things cannot live there.
//!
//! The first is `payload_hash`, which needs no database: the mismatch refusal
//! rests on the digest depending on the canonical rendering and on nothing else,
//! and on the smallest difference two renderings can have being enough to
//! separate them. A hasher that collapsed a one-byte edit would turn
//! `IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH` into a replay of the wrong answer.
//!
//! The second is [`take_over`]'s compare-and-swap, which needs a database *and*
//! a caller holding a row value the store has already moved past. The public
//! API cannot produce that: `claim` always reads the row immediately before it
//! acts on it, so no sequence of public calls hands `take_over` a stale `held`.
//! Reaching the private function directly is the only way to test the guard
//! **deterministically and single-threaded** — a concurrency test would prove
//! nothing on `SQLite`, whose single writer serializes the transactions the race
//! is made of. In-crate database tests have precedent
//! (`coord::lease::sqlite_tests`), and for the same reason: the assertion needs
//! something the public surface does not expose.
