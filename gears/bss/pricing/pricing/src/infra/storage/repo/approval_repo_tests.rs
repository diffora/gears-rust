//! The row-to-record reading, and the compare-and-swap — the two things the
//! public surface cannot be driven to.
//!
//! The database suite (`tests/sqlite_approval_repo.rs`) proves what the store
//! does; what is here is what that suite cannot reach.
//!
//! The first is the boundary's own judgement, which needs no database: the
//! CHECKs make the interesting rows unwritable — `chk_pricing_approval_state`
//! and `chk_pricing_approval_subject_kind` refuse them — so the only way to ask
//! "what does this repository do when the table was written around" is to hand
//! it the model directly.
//!
//! The second is [`swap`], which needs a database *and* a caller reaching the
//! `UPDATE` with a record the store has already moved past. No sequence of
//! public calls produces that: [`decide`] reads the record immediately before it
//! acts, so a decided one is turned away by §4's machine and never reaches the
//! statement. Calling the private function directly is the only way to execute
//! the guard **deterministically and single-threaded** — a concurrency test
//! would prove nothing on `SQLite`, whose single writer serializes the
//! transactions the race is made of. `idempotency_repo_tests` is the precedent
//! in this crate and `coord::lease::sqlite_tests` outside it, both for the same
//! reason.

///    would still equal the roster and still clear the floor. This version reads

///    names no kind of its own — silently borrowed the *next* site's literal.
