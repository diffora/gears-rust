//! The migration schedule's storage half (`inst-ms-api`, `inst-mg-idem`,
//! `inst-mst-start`, `inst-mst-complete`, `inst-mst-cancel`,
//! `inst-mst-cancel-inflight`, D-34, D-65).
//!
//! A runner-taking repository rather than a provider-holding one, for
//! [`super::audit_repo`]'s reason: every write here belongs to a transaction
//! that also emits an event or appends an audit record, and a schedule that
//! could commit separately from the `PlanMigrationScheduled` announcing it is a
//! schedule Subscriptions may never hear about.
//!
//! # M2 is the primary key, and [`insert_or_load`] is the whole of it
//!
//! `inst-ms-api` makes the create idempotent on a **client-supplied**
//! `migration_id`. The implementation is an `INSERT... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
//! followed by a load — [`super::idempotency_repo`]'s shape, and for the same
//! reason it gives there: the at-most-once guarantee **is** the statement, so two
//! concurrent creates of one `migration_id` cannot both succeed however they
//! interleave. A read-then-insert would be a race with a window exactly as wide
//! as the round trip.
//!
//! **A conflicting retry returns the stored row rather than an error.** That is
//! `inst-ms-api`'s own sentence — "a timed-out client retry returns the original
//! schedule, never a second one" — and it is why this function's name says
//! `or_load` rather than `or_fail`. The caller learns which happened from
//! [`Scheduled::created`], because a route that answered `202 Created` to a
//! replay would tell a client it had just scheduled something it scheduled an
//! hour ago.
//!
//! # The flips are compare-and-swaps on the state they leave
//!
//! `plan_repo::retire_revision`'s shape. Each `UPDATE` carries the **expected
//! current state** in its `WHERE`, so a concurrent writer that moved the row
//! first loses rather than overwrites: `rows_affected == 0` is never a silent
//! success. It is reported as [`RepoError::ConcurrentMutation`] while the row
//! still stands in the state the statement expected, and as
//! [`RepoError::MigrationStateForbidden`] once it has left — a predicate that can
//! never match again is not contention. The
//! table's trigger refuses the same edges independently — the machine is stated
//! in `domain::migration`, in the `CHECK`s and here, and this layer is the one
//! that makes the refusal a typed error rather than a driver string.
//!
//! # D-65's replay is a read, not a second write
//!
//! [`start`] is the only flip that can be called twice in the ordinary course of
//! events, because Subscriptions retries. It resolves that **before** attempting
//! the `UPDATE`: an already-`in_progress` row returns its persisted
//! `exclusion_snapshot` verbatim and re-transitions nothing. That ordering is the
//! rule rather than an optimisation — a recompute could differ from the set the
//! executor already honoured, and the table's `trg_pricing_migration_exclusion_replay`
//! arm refuses the write that would install a different one.

/// * `rest_migrations::a_replay_of_one_migration_id_answers_200_with_the_original_schedule`
///   does the same through the route. The refusal case named above cites it as the
///   route-level pin on this field and records that neither pin moved when the
///   diverging-body arm was closed — which is what makes these two questions

///
/// Neither is a fixture quietly carrying a fault; both are contract pins. Whether
