//! The two raw scope-key comparators, held to the key they claim to compare
//! (Z2-1, 2026-08-17).
//!
//! # Why this file is a test and not a refactor
//!
//! [`market_columns`] and [`scope_key_columns`] compare stored **columns** rather
//! than parsed [`ScopeKey`]s, and `scope_key_columns`' own doc gives the reason:
//! *"a comparison that had to parse first would answer 'corrupt' where the honest
//! answer is 'these two rows are not on one key'"*. That argument is sound and
//! this file does not touch it. What it supplies is the cover the argument costs.
//!
//! # What the cover has to be, and why the obvious one is not enough
//!
//! `domain::scope_key`'s register of ungated sites names three that build a key
//! **from** a row and says their partial cover is `ScopeKey::new`'s positional
//! signature — an axis added as a constructor parameter breaks them. There is a
//! fourth, and `market_columns` had **no** cover at all: it touches no
//! constructor, it is a bare eight-element tuple literal, and neither kind of
//! widening reaches it. It is also the worst place for that to be true:
//!
//! * It is deliberately partial — "all of them but `priceEligibility` and
//!   `cohort`" — so an eleventh axis silently absent from it does not read as
//!   "eight of ten". It reads as "modulo three axes", which is the shape the
//!   function is *supposed* to have.
//! * It is the row plane's last guard before `publish_rows`:
//!   [`refuse_ungenerational`] decides with it whether a cutover's grandfathered
//!   copy is a generation of the predecessor's market, and a comparison short by
//!   an axis admits a copy that differs on that axis onto a key nobody composed.
//! * It sits ten lines from `scope_key_columns`, whose doc is this crate's own
//!   account of exactly this defect shipping once: eight columns against a
//!   ten-axis key, from D-196 until 2026-08-06, which made `refuse_mispaired`
//!   read a successor on a **different meter of the same market** as being on the
//!   predecessor's key. The sweep that remediated that wrote the register of
//!   ungated sites and walked past the function immediately above the one it was
//!   documenting.
//!
//! So the cover here is not "these two tuples have ten and eight elements" — a
//! count is what a stale-count grep already fails at. It is one case **per axis**,
//! driven from an exhaustive [`ScopeKeyParts`] destructure, so an eleventh axis
//! makes this file stop compiling in the same commit that adds it.
