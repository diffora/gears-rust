//! The `migrated-origin` record's storage half (`inst-sy-provenance`,
//! `inst-sy-surface`, D-87, D-102).
//!
//! A runner-taking repository, for [`super::audit_repo`]'s reason: the freeze and
//! the audit record that governs it belong to one transaction.
//!
//! # Idempotency is the unique index, and the read-back is the point
//!
//! §9 requires a second synthesis attempt to be idempotent — *the same frozen
//! ref*. [`freeze_or_load`] is `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` plus a load,
//! [`super::idempotency_repo::claim`]'s shape: two concurrent syntheses of one
//! subscription cannot both land, and the loser is handed the winner's row rather
//! than an error. That is stronger than "check then write", which would leave a
//! window exactly as wide as the round trip — and in that window the two calls
//! would freeze **different instants**, because D-81 computes `t` per trigger and
//! the two triggers disagree.
//!
//! There is no `update` and no `delete` here, and none is missing: the table
//! refuses both outright.
