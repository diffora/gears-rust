//! Repository over `pricing_policy_object` — the per-tenant policy store
//! (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7).
//!
//! **One repository over the table, and the narrowing this file used to be has
//! since been paid off.** An earlier version of this doc said the row carried
//! three more policies whose readers did not exist yet — the approval threshold
//! at §4.2 step 3, the tax-display mode in Slice 4, the notice period when Slice
//! 11 schedules an enforced migration — and that a whole-row read would
//! therefore answer three questions nobody was asking. All three have moved.
//! The **approval threshold left this table altogether**: `m20260802_000018`
//! split it into `pricing_approval_threshold`, per-currency and versioned, and
//! dropped the old column pair in the same migration. The other two are read
//! now — `tax_display_policy_mode` at [`crate::infra::publish`] and by `GET
//! /config/tax-display-policy`, `enforced_migration_notice_days` at
//! [`crate::infra::migration`] when Slice 11 schedules. So [`AuthoringPolicy`]
//! carries **every** content column the row still has and one read resolves
//! them all, which is what the two runs of one publish need in order not to
//! disagree about what the tenant had configured.
//!
//! What this one reads is exactly what the **authoring** path resolves: the four
//! §14 caps and the descriptor required-set extension D-152 put in this table,
//! and — since 2026-08-03, when the publish path that reads it landed — the
//! **default rounding policy**. That one joined this method rather than getting
//! one of its own because it is resolved at the same moment and by the same
//! caller: the §4.2 step-2 pre-check and the commit's re-validation each build
//! one rule set for one tenant, and two reads to build it would be two chances
//! for the two runs to disagree about what the tenant had configured.
//!
//! # Seven of the eight content columns have no writer, here or anywhere
//!
//! [`set_tax_display_policy`] is the **only** writer of `pricing_policy_object`
//! in this crate, and it sets exactly one content column —
//! `tax_display_policy_mode` — beside the `updated_at_utc` / `updated_by`
//! stamps. An earlier version of this doc said *"there is no upsert here"*,
//! which stopped being true the day that function landed; what is true is the
//! narrower statement, and it is worth stating precisely because the seven
//! columns it leaves out are read on live paths:
//!
//! - `default_rounding_policy_ref` is permanently `None`, so every published row
//!   must carry its own `rounding_policy_ref` or fail `ROUNDING_POLICY_UNRESOLVED`
//!   (see [`AuthoringPolicy::default_rounding_policy_ref`]). The per-tenant
//!   default PRD §17.4 contemplates is declared and unreachable.
//! - `additional_required_descriptors` is permanently `[]`, so
//!   [`DescriptorSetComplete::extending_v1`] — D-152's mechanism — never
//!   extends, and `DESCRIPTOR_INCOMPLETE` can only ever check D-48 v1's pinned
//!   three.
//! - `enforced_migration_notice_days` is permanently the 60-day floor: a tenant
//!   can raise nothing, though D-49 says they may.
//! - the four §14 caps fall back to [`LimitsConfig`] for every tenant, which is
//!   benign in outcome and still means the per-tenant caps and their `CHECK`s
//!   guard a value nothing in this gear can set.
//!
//! **This is the state of the design set rather than an omission here.** The set
//! names exactly one authoring surface over this table — `GET/PUT
//! /bss-pricing/v1/config/tax-display-policy` (S4 §5,
//! `design/04-currency-tax.md`; its authz row, `design/05-governance.md` §5) —
//! and that surface is built ([`crate::api::rest::tax_display_policy`]). It
//! names **no** surface for the other seven: `/config/approval-threshold-policy`
//! writes `pricing_approval_threshold` and `/config/taxonomies` writes the
//! taxonomy tables, and those, with `/config/artifacts`, are every `/config`
//! path the set declares. D-152 is explicit that this carrier is *provisional*
//! for the four caps and the descriptor extension — the product owner confirmed
//! the columns here *"for now"* and expects them to move to a settings gear that
//! does not exist in this repository, so *"build against this carrier, and
//! expect the move"*. D-49 contemplates raising the notice period by *"an
//! explicit audited policy change"* (S11 `inst-mg-target`) and names no route
//! for one.
//!
//! So the missing writers are owed by a document nobody has written, and minting
//! them here would be the thing D-10/D-13 refuse: a policy change is not a row
//! write. One UPDATE on this table can make every plan of a tenant
//! unpublishable, which is exactly the materiality an approval unit exists to
//! hold — and the one write that does exist earns it by being the surface S4 §5
//! declares, authz-gated, `If-Match`ed and audited. Until the rest are declared
//! somewhere, a tenant's caps and descriptor extension are configurable only the
//! way this gear's own tests configure them: by a row written around it, with
//! the column `CHECK`s as the only guard.
//!
//! # The defect this closes, and why it is not a cache
//!
//! Four ratified numbers and the descriptor required-set extension were called
//! **tenant-configurable** by a ratified NFR and a pinned assumption while the
//! only carrier the code had was the gear's configuration section, which is per
//! **deployment**. Every tenant of a deployment shared one cap, and the
//! descriptor required-set had no declaration surface at all — so
//! `DESCRIPTOR_INCOMPLETE` could only ever check D-48's pinned three and "config
//! extensible without a schema change" described a capability with no
//! configuration to exercise it (D-152).
//!
//! **What D-152 closed was the carrier, not the surface.** The extension has a
//! declared home now and this repository reads it; nothing in the crate writes
//! it, per the section above, so the capability is still exercisable only by a
//! row written around the gear. The half that is paid is that a reader now knows
//! where the value would live and what absence means; the half that is owed is
//! the surface that puts one there.
//!
//! [`PolicyObjectRepo::authoring_policy`] is on the **authoring** path — the
//! §4.2 step-2 pre-check and the publish commit's re-validation — and never on a
//! resolution path. It is a point read on the primary key, once per validation
//! run, so nothing here is memoized: a cached cap is a cap that keeps rejecting
//! plans after an operator has raised it, and the two runs of one publish would
//! be free to disagree about the limit they enforced.
//!
//! # The carrier is provisional
//!
//! These settings read from a pricing table today because there is no settings
//! gear in this repository to read them from; D-152's confirmation records that
//! they are expected to move to one when it exists, and that
//! `gears/simple-user-settings` is not it (per **user**, so a tenant-wide cap
//! has no row to occupy). Build against this repository, and expect the move.
