//! Repository for the plan aggregate's **revision chain** (`pricing_plan`,
//! D-56 / D-83 / D-90 / D-128).
//!
//! A plan is not a row, so this is not a CRUD repository over one. It is the
//! authoring half of `design/01-foundation.md` §4.2 step 1 — create a draft,
//! edit it, abandon it, or open the next revision — and every method exists
//! because the chain has an invariant that would otherwise be enforced nowhere
//! but in a caller's discipline.
//!
//! **The compare-and-swap is one statement, not a read then a write.**
//! [`update_draft`] and [`abandon_draft`] match on the row version the caller
//! read *inside* the UPDATE that acts on it, and the bump is
//! `row_version = row_version + 1` in that same statement. Computing the
//! successor in Rust would let two writers holding the same current version
//! compute the same next one and both write it — the silent overwrite
//! `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-fr-concurrent-edit` forbids, reintroduced by the helper
//! meant to prevent it. `domain::concurrency::RowVersion` has no increment for
//! exactly this reason.
//!
//! **Nothing here deletes a revision row.** A discarded draft is flipped to the
//! terminal `abandoned` state, so the `revision` number it consumed stays
//! consumed and `(plan_id, revision)` names one row for the life of the plan
//! (D-145). [`open_revision`] mints from `max(revision) + 1` over the plan's own
//! rows for the same reason — see its own note on what deriving from the
//! current revision would hand out twice.
//!
//! **A revision never moves without its shape.** D-83 versions the child shape
//! tables with the revision, so [`open_revision`] copies them forward and
//! [`abandon_draft`] drops the discarded revision's copies — each inside the
//! **one transaction** that moves the revision row, because a revision that
//! exists without its shape is a draft that looks like a plan whose author
//! deleted everything, and a tombstone that kept its copies is a frozen shape
//! hanging off a row nothing can reach. The two orderings are opposite and both
//! forced by the child tables' append-only trigger, which reads the parent
//! revision: the copy follows the insert because the INSERT arm requires the
//! **new** parent to be `draft`, and the drop precedes the flip because
//! `abandoned` is not `draft` and the DELETE arm would refuse it afterwards.
//!
//! **A failed swap gets three answers, not one.** Zero rows affected is
//! ambiguous by construction — the predicate is a conjunction — so the row is
//! read back once and the refusal names which conjunct failed:
//! [`RepoError::NotFound`] (absent, or another tenant's),
//! [`RepoError::NotDraft`] (frozen, which now includes an already-abandoned
//! revision), [`RepoError::StaleRowVersion`] (a read the caller never
//! refreshed). One undifferentiated conflict would tell an operator to retry in
//! the one case where retrying can never work.
//!
//! **The draft-only guard is enforced here as well as by the trigger.** §4.3 is
//! explicit that immutability is enforced twice, and the second enforcement is
//! not redundancy: the table trigger's answer is a raw database error carrying
//! no state and no subject, which reaches a caller as an internal fault. The
//! predicate on these statements is what turns "you are editing a frozen
//! revision" into something a surface can render.
//!
//! **One Slice-2 rule is unreachable through this file, and stays a rule.**
//! `chk_pricing_plan_purchase_qty` refuses `purchase_min_qty > purchase_max_qty`
//! at the column, so no row written here can ever be the subject
//! [`PURCHASE_QTY_RANGE_INVALID`](crate::domain::plan_rules::PURCHASE_QTY_RANGE_INVALID)
//! describes. The rule is not therefore redundant: the validation pipeline
//! judges a shape the **caller** assembled, before any of it is a row, and it
//! owes an author one report enumerating every finding. Deleting the rule would
//! move that finding onto the driver-error path, where a publish attempt answers
//! with an internal fault instead of a line somebody can act on.
//!
//! **The caller is `api::rest::plans`' `require_authorable_purchase_window`**, which
//! runs the same rule at the parse of both verbs, and these two statements are the
//! backstop the paragraph above claims they are. Without it the rule has no door:
//! every `run_publish_rules` subject is assembled *from storage*, so the only path
//! an inverted window would have is the `INSERT` here and the `UPDATE` in
//! [`update_draft_on`] — both of which answer `RepoError::Db`, rendering
//! `500 … please retry later` for a payload whose whole remedy is one field.
//!
//! [`update_draft`]: PlanRepo::update_draft
//! [`abandon_draft`]: PlanRepo::abandon_draft
//! [`open_revision`]: PlanRepo::open_revision

    /// re-derives against whatever draft is open next and `revision` is hashed —
    /// but `inst-as-void` asks for `voided`, not for a record that refuses
    /// forever, and a record that refuses forever is an indefinite lock on the
    /// plan's subject under `PENDING_CHANGE_UNIT_EXISTS`.

    ///
    /// It stays anyway, and the reason is the one this module's TOCTOU doc gives
    /// for not trusting an inheritance argument: "on today's paths" is a claim
    /// about a set of surfaces, and the last time it was made — that a mutation
    /// could not reach a pinned subject without passing through the two audit

/// # This is also the TOCTOU void's rail (`inst-ap-pin`)

/// the phase graph, the add-on rule set, the descriptor set, the derived meters
/// (Slice 10), a bundle's composition (Slice 8, D-92, which rides its plan's
/// revision) and the draft abandon — so a pending approval unit pinned to that
/// plan is voided here, in the mutation's own transaction.
/// `price_repo::record_price_mutation` is the same rail for the row plane. The
/// list is written out rather than counted: a facet joining the rail inherits the
/// void correctly, which is the property the placement buys, and a number in the
/// prose beside it would be the only thing that went stale.
///
/// Placed on the audit writer rather than at each of those seven call sites for
/// the reason the whole rule exists: this phase permits **no unaudited mutating
/// entry point**, so a surface a later slice adds cannot reach a pinned subject
/// without passing through here, and it inherits the void instead of needing to
/// remember it. The full surface enumeration, including the two paths that
/// deliberately do **not** void, is in
/// [`crate::infra::approval::void_pending_units_of`]'s doc.
///
/// The plan's **creation** paths ([`create_draft_on`] and
/// [`PlanRepo::create_draft`]) append their record directly and not through this
/// function, which is why `create_plan` does not void: no unit can be pinned to
/// a plan that did not exist.
///
/// # And it is the `PlanUpdated` rail, for the same reason
///
/// S2 §7 puts `PlanUpdated` "on authoring" and S10 §7 has the advanced
/// primitives "ride `PlanUpdated`" rather than mint a name; PRD AC #98 emits it
/// "after mutation". Every one of those mutations already passes through here,
/// so the producer is here too — at the choke point rather than at the six of
/// the seven call sites above that carry an edit, exactly as the void is, and
/// for the identical reason: a facet a later slice adds inherits the
/// announcement instead of having to remember it. Six hand-placed enqueues is
/// the shape that leaves the seventh silent.
///
/// **It is emitted on [`AuditAction::Update`] and on nothing else.** The other
/// action reaching this rail is [`AuditAction::Abandon`], and D-145's whole point
/// is that discarding a draft is a terminal lifecycle flip rather than an edit:
/// the frozen set has no name for it, and announcing it as a content change would
/// tell a consumer to re-read a revision that just stopped being readable. The
/// discrimination is on the act, not on the caller, so a future action added to
/// this rail is silent until someone decides what it announces.
///
/// # Errors
/// [`RepoError::Db`] or [`RepoError::CorruptRow`] from the chain append, both of
/// which roll the mutation back with them. That is the point: a mutation whose
/// record cannot be written must not commit, or the trail becomes silently
/// incomplete. [`RepoError::Db`] from the void, for the same reason one construct
/// over: a mutation that could not close the approval it invalidated must not
/// commit either. [`RepoError::ConcurrentMutation`] from the enqueue, which is
/// the same posture a third time: an edit that committed without its event would
/// leave a consumer resolving a draft nobody told it had moved.
// The choke point every audited revision mutation passes through, on three
// repositories — so one span here names the act for the append, the approval void
// and the outbox row it performs, whichever repository entered it.
