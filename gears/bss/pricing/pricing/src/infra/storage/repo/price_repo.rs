//! Repository for **draft** price rows and the tier bands that belong to them
//! (`pricing_price` + `pricing_price_tier_band`, `design/03-price-structure.md`
//! §5, `design/01-foundation.md` §4.1 / §4.3).
//!
//! A price row is not one table. Everything single-valued about it — the
//! amount, the package block, the evaluation policy — sits on the row, and only
//! the band set, being many-per-row, has a table of its own. So every operation
//! here writes **both** tables or neither, and the reasons are physical rather
//! than tidy:
//!
//! **A row and its bands land together.** Bands inserted before their parent are
//! rejected outright by the band table's structural-exclusivity trigger, which
//! reads the parent's `model_kind`; bands landing after a committed parent leave
//! a window in which a `graduated` row has no geometry at all, and the Slice-3
//! rules would judge it as a tiered row that prices nothing. One transaction
//! removes both states.
//!
//! **The bands go first on the way out.** The foreign key declares the default
//! `NO ACTION` on both backends — nothing cascades and nothing nulls — and sqlx
//! turns `foreign_keys` ON for `SQLite`, so deleting a draft row that still has
//! bands fails with an opaque constraint error.
//! `ON DELETE CASCADE` is *not* the fix: Postgres fires the child's row triggers
//! on a cascade and `SQLite` fires them only under `recursive_triggers`, so
//! cascading would make the append-only guard mean two different things on the
//! two backends — the one divergence the mirrored schema exists to prevent.
//! Deleting the children explicitly, inside the transaction, is what keeps the
//! guard identical.
//!
//! **A band's `tenant_id` comes from its parent row, never from the request.**
//! The foreign key covers `price_id` alone, so nothing in the schema stops a
//! band carrying a different tenant from the row it points at — and under
//! `SecureORM` such a band is invisible to its true owner while still joined by
//! `price_id` to their price. The value is therefore copied from the row this
//! repository just wrote, and no caller is offered the choice.
//!
//! **There is deliberately no band-level mutation.** Bands carry no entity tag
//! of their own, so a band edit that did not move the parent's `row_version`
//! would let two authors editing different bands of one draft both satisfy
//! `If-Match` and silently interleave — the outcome
//! `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-fr-concurrent-edit` forbids. Bands are written only
//! through [`PriceRepo::create_draft`], [`PriceRepo::update_draft`] and
//! [`PriceRepo::delete_draft`], and the band set is replaced wholesale inside
//! the same transaction as the row's compare-and-swap.
//!
//! **The compare-and-swap is one statement, and a failed swap gets three
//! answers.** Both are exactly `PlanRepo`'s shape and for exactly its reasons:
//! the `row_version + 1` bump rides inside the UPDATE that matches on the
//! version the caller read, and `rows_affected == 0` is resolved by one extra
//! read into [`RepoError::NotFound`], [`RepoError::NotDraft`] or
//! [`RepoError::StaleRowVersion`], because only one of those three is worth
//! retrying.
//!
//! **The draft-only predicate is enforced here as well as by the triggers.**
//! `pricing_price_tier_band` rejects INSERT, UPDATE *and* DELETE against a
//! non-draft parent. This repository only ever touches bands of a draft parent,
//! and does not lean on the trigger for the caller-facing refusal: the trigger's
//! answer is a raw database error carrying no state, and a caller that edited a
//! published row deserves to be told that, not that the store is broken. What
//! guarantees it is one read taken inside the transaction, before the first band
//! statement — [`mutable_draft`] — because both mutating paths now reach the
//! band table *before* the compare-and-swap has answered. The swap is still the
//! authority; the read only decides which sentence a doomed call gets.
//!
//! **Bands come back ordered by `from_qty`, ascending.** That is a read-side
//! guarantee and it is load-bearing. The band table is keyed
//! `(price_id, from_qty)` and carries no ordinal, so authoring order does not
//! survive a round trip; `inst-tb-order` was amended for exactly this after a
//! rule judged band geometry by the author's in-memory ordering and therefore
//! reached one verdict at save and another at publish, from the identical rule.
//!
//! **`PriceRow::charge_kind` is the key's, not a second column.** The row type
//! carries the axis because half the shape rules are a function of it, and
//! `price_row.rs` says as much — it is "not authored on the row itself". So the
//! store keeps exactly one copy, the scope key's, and a record read back always
//! agrees with its own key; a caller that hands the two different answers is
//! given the key's rather than a refusal, because there is no second value for
//! them to have disagreed about.
//!
//! **Superseding a published scope key is a different door, in this file.** It is
//! the D-88 supersession unit — successor row, predecessor-window shorten and
//! successor-window schedule composed gap-free in one commit, setting
//! `supersedes_price_id` — and its row half is
//! [`insert_successor_draft_on`], whose occupancy precondition is the mirror
//! image of [`PriceRepo::create_draft`]'s: a published occupant is what it
//! requires rather than what it refuses (**D-195**). The row half of the commit is
//! below (`commit_supersession_rows`), the compose is `domain::supersession` and the
//! cross-plane commit is `infra::supersession`; what is **not** built is the
//! orchestrator, the approval unit and the route, so no mounted surface reaches this
//! door yet.
//!
//! `create_draft` is unchanged and must still not be reached for on an occupied
//! key: the authoring door refuses a key an occupied published row holds rather
//! than taking it over, which is `inst-pr-return`'s save-time duplicate check and
//! is what keeps one draft per key the most the two doors admit between them.

/// CONTRACT paragraph, which now carries the full argument.
///
/// # Why the pre-read, and why it is not the guard
///
/// The version conjunction is checked **before** the UPDATE as well as by the
/// UPDATE's own row count, and the order is forced: after the UPDATE this
/// transaction reads its own writes, so a row that legitimately moved to
/// `published` is indistinguishable from one that never matched. Taken first,
/// the read names which conjunct failed — absent, frozen, or stale — the way
/// every other compare-and-swap in this file does. The **count** is still the
/// guard, and it covers the one window the read cannot: a concurrent commit
/// landing between two adjacent statements.
///
/// # The rest, unchanged
///
/// **One UPDATE, not a per-row negotiation**, and the two partial unique indexes
/// are why that is safe. The draft-plane index (D-148,
/// `WHERE lifecycle_state = 'draft'`) releases a key as its row leaves `draft`
/// and the published-plane index claims it as the row arrives, both inside this
/// statement. [`PriceRepo::create_draft`] already refuses a scope key occupied by
/// a `draft` **or** a `published` row, so a plan's draft rows sit on keys nothing
/// else holds; a concurrent publish of a *second* plan cannot collide because
/// every key carries `plan_id`.
///
/// # The one draft row that does **not** sit on a free key, and what it owes
///
/// The paragraph above was the whole argument while the authoring door was the
/// only door. It is not any more: [`insert_successor_draft_on`] stages a successor
/// **beside** the published row it will supersede (D-195), which is exactly a
/// draft row on a key something else holds — and this statement flips it while
/// that something is still `published`, so `uq_pricing_price_scope_key_current`
/// refuses it. Measured, not reasoned: the refusal arrives as a raw driver
/// unique-violation, so it reaches the caller as [`RepoError::Db`] — **a 500, not
/// a refusal an operator can act on**.
///
/// This function is nevertheless **unchanged**, and deliberately so. The remedy is
/// an ordering the supersession commit owes rather than a check here:
/// `inst-su-commit` flips the predecessor `published → superseded` **before** the
/// successor's publish, in the same transaction, and with the key free on the
/// published plane this statement is ordinary again. A guard here could only
/// re-refuse what the index already refuses, one round trip earlier and for every
/// publish, to catch a caller that has skipped a documented step of its own
/// commit; `tests/sqlite_price_repo.rs` pins both arms instead.
///
/// **`draft -> published` is the row's only edge out of `draft`** and this is the
/// sanctioned producer of it. The predicate is restated here rather than left to
/// the table because §4.3 enforces immutability twice and the physical guard's
/// answer is a raw driver error carrying no state — and the physical half now
/// exists on this table too: D-153's draft-plane whitelist was missing from
/// `pricing_price` (the trigger returned early for a draft row) and was amended
/// into `m20260802_000002` on both backends while this guard was being written.
///
/// The `row_version` is deliberately **not** bumped. §3.7 says the tag freezes
/// with the content it names (D-141) and this flip changes no content; after it

/// # Atomicity, and which move goes first
///
/// Both statements run in the caller's transaction, so `inst-su-commit`'s "or
/// everything rolls back" holds for the pair. The order serves the *failure* path
/// as well as the index: with the flip first, a successor the publish refuses
/// leaves a transaction that rolls the flip back with it, and the state that is
/// never briefly true is the one where the key has no current row at all —
/// coverage removed, nothing selling — which is worse than either move not having
/// happened.
///
/// # The predecessor's tag does not move, and is not a precondition either
///
/// The flip is a compare-and-swap on the row's **state**, not on its version.
/// D-141 freezes the row version with the published row's content and exempts the
/// `lifecycle_state` flips from moving it, so there is no version for a caller to
/// present and none to bump: a tag that moved under a representation no caller can
/// write to would report a stale cache that is not stale. What the swap is against
/// is `lifecycle_state = 'published'`, and that is what makes a replayed commit
/// refuse rather than re-flip a row that has already moved.
///
/// The successor's version **is** presented, because its content stays mutable
/// right up to this statement. That precondition is [`publish_rows`]', unchanged,
/// and this function delegates to it rather than restating it.
///
/// # No audit record here
///
/// The publish commit writes one record for the whole act at the subject's level
/// rather than one per row moved — see
/// [`PublishService::commit`](crate::infra::publish::PublishService::commit) step 6,
/// where [`publish_rows`] is likewise silent. The supersession unit's record is
/// [`crate::infra::supersession::SupersessionService`]'s, which is the layer holding
/// its approval reference.
///
/// # The pair is checked, and the key is the load-bearing half
///
/// The two ids arrive as independent arguments, so nothing about the *call* says they
/// belong together — and this function enforced only their **order** until a review
/// pointed out it enforced nothing about their **pairing** (2026-08-05). A predecessor
/// on one key and a successor on another key of the same plan committed cleanly:
/// `supersede_row` never looks at the successor, and [`publish_rows`] filters by
/// `plan_id` rather than by key. The result is the predecessor's key left with **no
/// current row at all** — the state this function's own ordering argument calls worse
/// than either move not having happened.
///
/// So both rows are read first and two relations are required:
///
/// - **The same canonical scope key.** This is the load-bearing one. A supersession is
///   by definition a change on *one* key (`inst-ps-supersede`), so a differing key is
///   not a mispaired supersession, it is two unrelated acts wearing one transaction.
/// - **`successor.supersedes_price_id == Some(predecessor)`** (D-127). This is the
///   second belt, and it is second rather than first because it is **spoofable**:
///   `supersedes_price_id` is caller-supplied content on the authoring routes
///   (`PriceContentView` carries it, and `POST`/`PATCH` plumb it through unvalidated),
///   so [`insert_successor_draft_on`]'s claim to be the only writer of it is false. It
///   still earns its place — it catches a draft authored on a free key that the key's
///   later occupant would otherwise look paired with.
///
/// One extra read for the pair, which buys a refusal in place of a silently
/// uncovered key.
///
/// # Errors
/// [`RepoError::NotSupersedable`] when the predecessor is not the key's current row

///
/// - a **published** occupant is the **precondition**. It is the row being

///   the same presupposition of current coverage `inst-su-compose` states from the
///   window side when it fails compose on a dormant key, read here off the row
///   plane. The remedy the design names for that key is a plain publish plus a
///   window schedule, not a supersession, so the refusal is `NotFound` on the key
///   rather than a conflict inviting a retry.
/// - a **draft** occupant is the **refusal**. On a key carrying a published row a
///   hand-authored draft is impossible by the paragraph above, so a draft here is
///   a composition that already staged its successor. Between the two doors, one
///   draft per key therefore stays the most that is admitted, which is the
///   guarantee §3.7's D-148 argument rests on.
///
/// The order of the two is not arbitrary: a key with no current row is answered as
/// unsupersedable even when a draft stands on it, because "publish this key
/// instead" is the actionable half and the draft is beside the point.
///
/// # The refusal a draft occupant gets is the floor, not the whole answer
///
/// `DUPLICATE_SCOPE_KEY` is what the store can say. The operator-facing answer for
/// a key a pending unit holds is `PENDING_CHANGE_UNIT_EXISTS`
/// (`inst-co-single-pending`), and it belongs to the approval plane, which knows
/// about units; this refusal is what remains for a draft no live unit explains.
/// The read is also still a **read**, so two concurrent composers can both pass
/// it and the draft-plane partial `UNIQUE` decides — the same race, with the same
/// narrowing owed to the surface, that [`PriceRepo::create_draft`]'s doc sets out.
///
/// # The link is stamped here
///
/// `supersedes_price_id` is written from the same read that validated the key
/// (D-127 requires the successor to carry it), overwriting whatever the caller sent —
/// this door is the only reader positioned to be right about it.
///
/// **It is not the only *writer*, and an earlier version of this paragraph claimed it
/// was** (corrected 2026-08-05 by review). `PriceContentView` carries
/// `supersedes_price_id` as a request field and both `POST …/prices` and
/// `PATCH …/prices/{priceId}` plumb it through unvalidated, so any client on the
/// authoring plane can give a hand-authored draft an arbitrary link. Stamping here
/// therefore makes the link right on *this* path and cannot make a disagreement
/// unexpressible — which is why `commit_supersession_rows` checks the pair rather than
/// trusting the stamp, with key equality as the load-bearing half.
///
/// # What this does **not** do
///
/// It does not flip the predecessor. That is the commit's move and it is ordered
/// **before** the successor's publish (`inst-su-commit`, D-195): §3.7 admits one
/// published row per key, so a successor flipped while its predecessor still reads
/// `published` dies on `uq_pricing_price_scope_key_current` as a raw driver error.
/// After compose, both rows legitimately stand on the key and the predecessor is
/// untouched.
///
/// **What it does do beyond the three writes, which this section used to omit**
/// (review, 2026-08-05): it reaches [`record_price_mutation`] through
/// [`write_prepared`], so it appends the row's audit entry **and voids the plan's
/// pending `plan_revision` units** ([`crate::infra::approval::void_pending_units_of`],
/// keyed on the plan rather than the key). Composing on one key therefore voids a
/// pending plan-revision unit whose change set is about *another* key, which is wider
/// than `inst-co-single-pending`'s per-key rule and is pre-existing
/// `void_pending_units_of` semantics rather than this door's invention.
///
/// **"Every `submitted` unit of the plan" stood here and was measured false**
/// (2026-08-06): `approval_repo::void_pending_for_plan` filters
/// `subject_kind = 'plan_revision'`, so it reaches neither a `window` unit nor a
/// `price_unit` one — and a supersession's own unit is a `price_unit`. The consequence
/// the sentence was warning about therefore does not exist: this door **cannot** void
/// the unit composing it, so the ordering the orchestrator keeps (stage, then open) is
/// not a defence against that. It is kept for the reason a probe measured instead —
/// the unit's content pin has to cover the staged successor, or every attempt to
