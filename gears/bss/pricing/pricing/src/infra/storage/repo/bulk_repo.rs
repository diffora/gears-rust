//! Repository for `pricing_bulk_operation` and `pricing_bulk_row_lock` — a bulk
//! run and the rows it holds while it commits
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §4, §6; D-260, D-262, D-267).
//!
//! # The state machine is the trigger's, and this repository does not restate it
//!
//! [`advance`] names a target state and writes it. Whether the move is an edge is
//! the table's business, on both engines, and the refusal it raises is the one an
//! operator reads. A `match` here listing the legal edges would be a second
//! spelling of a rule that already exists in two places — and `rejected` arriving
//! four migrations after the table is the demonstration that the two would drift.
//!
//! **What the trigger cannot judge, and what [`advance`] therefore carries**. The deferral
//! above covers the *edge*; it does not cover the caller's *premise*. Two holes are left by it,
//! and both are the same shape:
//!
//! * A move to the state a run is already in returns early on both engines
//!   (`NEW.state = OLD.state` → `RETURN NEW`), so a repeat is admitted in
//!   silence — and `advance` rewrites `report` and `completed_at` wholesale, so
//!   the repeat clobbers the run's stored answer with whatever the late caller
//!   carried.
//! * A caller acting on a state it read a moment ago may name a target that is a
//!   legal edge from where the row *now* stands: `validating -> committing` and
//!   `awaiting_approval -> committing` are both edges, so an immateriality
//!   decision taken over `validating` would commit a run a concurrent evaluation
//!   had meanwhile parked for approval.
//!
//! So [`advance`] takes the state the caller believes the run is in and puts it in
//! the `WHERE`. That is not a second spelling of the edge list — it is the
//! caller's own premise, which no trigger can know — and it is the arrangement
//! every state-moving write in this crate already uses
//! (`approval_repo::swap`, `overlay_repo`, `window_repo`, `pin_frontier_repo`,
//! `policy_repo`, `idempotency_repo`). `window_repo`'s own sentence is the rule:
//! "a tag read, compared and then handed to a statement is a decision racing the
//! write it authorizes".
//!
//! # The lock's mutual exclusion is its primary key
//!
//! `pricing_bulk_row_lock` is keyed `(tenant_id, price_id)`, so two runs cannot
//! hold one row: the second insert collides. [`take_locks`] therefore does not
//! read first and then write — it writes, and reads only to *name* the holder in
//! the refusal, which is what `fr-concurrent-edit` asks for. The read-then-write
//! arrangement would be the check-then-act race the key exists to close.
//!
//! **A lock row names a holder that is committed.** Unlike the approval
//! register's pending-key conflict, which cannot name its holder because the
//! winning transaction may not have committed, a lock is inserted by a run that
//! is already `committing` — so the row this repository reads back is durable and
//! the refusal can carry it.
