//! The four tenant taxonomies' read and write surface —
//! `design/04-currency-tax.md` §5's `GET/PUT /config/taxonomies/{…}`, §6's table,
//! and `inst-tx-mutation`'s retire guard.
//!
//! # This is the repository the four tables have been waiting for
//!
//! The tables landed on Slice 9's chain (`m20260802_000028`…`000031`) because
//! `inst-plv-scope` had to validate an overlay's scope value against *something*
//! and the alternative was shipping a rule against thin air — the D-211 defect
//! named in their own migration docs. What they got was one read,
//! [`overlay_repo::taxonomy_declares`](super::overlay_repo::OverlayRepo::taxonomy_declares),
//! and **no writer at all**. An operator could not author a brand-scoped overlay
//! end to end, because there was nowhere to put the brand.
//!
//! So the read here is deliberately *not* a second copy of that one. This module
//! owns the **set** reads an operator and the publish pipeline need — the whole
//! declared list, the active region universe, and D-01's readiness markers —
//! while the single-value membership probe stays where Slice 9 put it. Two
//! functions answering "is this value declared" would be two predicates to keep
//! in step, and the one that drifted would be the one nobody was looking at.
//!
//! # The `PUT` is the whole set, and absence is retirement rather than deletion
//!
//! §5 gives this resource an `ETag` and §6 gives its rows a `state` with a
//! guarded transition and a legal way back. Both point the same way: the resource
//! is *the tenant's taxonomy*, not a row, so the `PUT` carries the complete value
//! set exactly as the approval-threshold policy's does — *"the **whole** policy,
//! not a patch"*.
//!
//! What absence means is the one real decision, and it is **retire, never
//! delete**. Deleting would break the guard's whole purpose: a value a published
//! row names has to keep existing, because the row keeps naming it. Retiring is
//! the state §6 declares for exactly this, it is reversible (*"a `PUT` re-adding
//! an existing retired value re-activates it"*), and it is what makes the
//! resource a faithful representation — a value the operator left out of the
//! body is a value they are done with, and the response says so rather than
//! silently keeping it active.
//!
//! **A retirement the guard refuses fails the whole `PUT`.** One transaction, one
//! verdict: a partial application would leave the tenant holding a taxonomy that
//! is neither what they sent nor what they had, and the `ETag` they read it back
//! under would describe neither.
//!
//! # What counts as a reference, and the reading that is deliberate
//!
//! §3 step 3 refuses a retirement while the value is referenced by *"an active
//! published price row (`region`) **or** an active `PriceOverlay` scope of any
//! taxonomy-backed class"*. Both counts are over `lifecycle_state = 'published'`.
//!
//! `superseded` is deliberately **not** counted, and the argument is that
//! retiring a taxonomy value does not touch the rows that name it. A superseded
//! row keeps its `region` string, keeps its window, and keeps resolving for the
//! arrears periods `PROJECTED_ROW_STATES` exists to preserve; what retirement
//! withdraws is the value's ability to validate something *new*. Counting
//! history would refuse the retirement of every region a tenant ever
//! repriced — which is to say, of every region they actually use.
//!
//! `draft` is not counted for the mirror reason: a draft is not yet a
//! commitment, and a value blocked by somebody's unpublished experiment is a
//! value no operator can retire on a schedule.
