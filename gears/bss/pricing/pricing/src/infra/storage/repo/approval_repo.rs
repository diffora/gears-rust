//! Reads and writes of `pricing_approval` behind the tenant gate
//! (`design/05-governance.md` §6).
//!
//! Three free functions taking a **runner** rather than a provider, for the
//! reason [`audit_repo`](super::audit_repo) and
//! [`catalog_version_ref_repo`](super::catalog_version_ref_repo) take one: an
//! approval record that could commit separately from the act it authorizes is
//! evidence of something that may not have happened. `open` runs inside the
//! transaction that evaluated materiality; `decide` runs inside the transaction
//! that will also write the decision's audit record; and a decision that
//! committed while its trail rolled back would leave `pricing_audit_log`
//! answering "who approved this" with nothing.
//!
//! # `decide` takes an outcome, not a state
//!
//! The parameter is an [`ApprovalDecision`] — approve, reject or withdraw — and
//! not an [`ApprovalState`]. That is a correction. While it took a state,
//! `decide(…, Submitted, …)` was a call anybody could write, and on a *pending*
//! record it answered `APPROVAL_NOT_PENDING` (409) reading "approval X is
//! submitted; only a submitted record is decidable" — a refusal contradicting
//! itself, produced by folding every [`TransitionRefusal`] through one
//! constructor. The domain already carried the type that makes the self-edge
//! unrepresentable and argued from it that
//! [`TransitionRefusal::code`](crate::domain::approval::TransitionRefusal::code)
//! may answer `None` for [`TransitionRefusal::NotAnOutcome`]; the argument was
//! sound and the type had no production caller, so the store was the one place
//! the unreachable refusal was in fact reachable. Now it is not.
//!
//! What that buys the fold below: [`ApprovalState::decide`] can only fail
//! `NotPending`, and `NotPending`'s state is the record's own, so
//! `map_err(|_| not_pending(…, current.state))` states a true sentence rather
//! than a plausible one. `approval_tests::no_decision_is_ever_refused_as_not_an_outcome`
//! is what keeps that true over the whole state x decision product.
//!
//! # `decide` is a compare-and-swap, and the state machine is consulted twice
//!
//! [`ApprovalState::decide`] refuses on the row this call read, so the caller
//! gets the reason rather than a driver error. Then the `UPDATE` carries
//! its **own** `state = 'submitted'` predicate, and matching no row is the same
//! refusal: between the read and the write another decision may have landed, and
//! a repository that trusted its read would let two reviewers both believe they
//! decided one record. `pin_frontier_repo::advance` enforces its forward-only
//! rule the same way and for the same reason.
//!
//! The store holds the rule a third time (`trg_pricing_approval_append_only`).
//! That is not redundancy: the trigger is what an ad-hoc `UPDATE` meets, and
//! this is what a caller meets.
//!
//! # What this module deliberately does not enforce, and what that costs
//!
//! **The two-person rule's surface refusal, and the reject's mandatory reason.**
//! `chk_pricing_approval_distinct_principals` and `chk_pricing_approval_reason`
//! make both unstorable, and that is all that happens *here*. The refusals
//! `inst-tp-distinct` and `inst-as-reject` specify —
//! `SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN` (403) with its audited attempted-violation record,
//! and `REASON_REQUIRED` — are enforced one layer up, in
//! [`crate::infra::approval::ApprovalService::decide`], over the pure judgement
//! [`authorize_decision`](crate::domain::approval::authorize_decision).
//!
//! That split is deliberate rather than residual. A refusal raised here could
//! not write the `deny` record `inst-tp-selfaudit` binds it to: the record must
//! survive the rolled-back decision transaction, and this function *is* inside
//! it. So the store keeps the physical impossibility and the service keeps the
//! answer, and the two are not free to disagree — the store's CHECK is what a
//! caller that bypassed the service meets.
//!
//! # The four trailing arguments were **not** folded into a typed outcome, and
//! that is a decision
//!
//! The shape considered was `Approved { approver }` / `Rejected { approver,
//! reason }` / `Voided { reason }`, which would make
//! `chk_pricing_approval_reason` and `chk_pricing_approval_approver`
//! *unrepresentable* rather than merely refused. G2 deferred it so one rule
//! would keep one owner; this group owns the rule and did not take it.
//!
//! The reason is not budget. Folding them makes a reason-less reject
//! **unconstructible**, and the only executable evidence that
//! `chk_pricing_approval_reason` still exists is a test that constructs one:
//! `tests/sqlite_approval_repo.rs::a_reject_without_a_reason_is_still_refused_by_the_check_beneath_the_code`.
//! Deleting that test to buy a type-level guarantee would trade a guard that is
//! *proved* for one that is *argued* — and the CHECK would still be there,
//! unexercised, free to be dropped by a later migration with the whole crate
//! green. That is the exact defect class this phase's Postgres track exists to
//! close.
//!
//! What replaced the type-level answer is a surface-level one:
//! [`crate::infra::approval::ApprovalService::decide`] refuses a reason-less
//! reject with `REASON_REQUIRED` before this function is called, so nothing on a
//! wire path reaches the CHECK — and the CHECK is what a caller that went round
//! the service meets. Two lines, both executed.
//!
//! **That argument covered `reason` and it did not cover `approver`, which was
//! the hole.** "Nothing on a wire path reaches the CHECK" was true of
//! `chk_pricing_approval_reason` and false of `chk_pricing_approval_approver`:
//! an approve naming no approver passed every check in
//! [`authorize_decision`](crate::domain::approval::authorize_decision) — the
//! distinctness rule read `None` as *not the submitter* — and landed here, where
//! the CHECK answered with a 500. The two are not symmetric, and the fix is not
//! in this signature: a reason-less reject is a **request a code refuses**, so
//! it must stay constructible, while an approver-less approve is a request §5
//! has no code for, so it must not be constructible at all. The pairing is typed
//! one layer up, on
//! [`DecisionBy`](crate::domain::approval::DecisionBy); the four arguments here
//! stay exactly as they were, and `a_reject_without_a_reason_is_still_refused_by_the_check_beneath_the_code`
//! still constructs one.
//!
//! # The [`AuditStamp`] is threaded now, and the trail is written **here**
//!
//! This section used to record an unpaid constraint: every other mutating
//! repository in this crate takes a stamp, this one did not, and the omission was
//! reported rather than absorbed because `AuditAction` declared no `submit`,
//! `approve`, `reject` or `withdraw` token — so a stamp threaded then would have
//! named a record these functions could not write, "a parameter that reads as a
//! guarantee and produces nothing". The tokens landed with this change, so the
//! stamp lands with them: [`open`] and [`decide`] each take one and each append
//! the record **inside the caller's transaction**, which is what the module's
//! opening paragraph already required of the store — *"a decision that committed
//! while its trail rolled back would leave `pricing_audit_log` answering 'who
//! approved this' with nothing"*. That sentence is now enforced rather than
//! merely stated.
//!
//! The record's segment is the **plan's** (D-135, [`subject_plan`]), so an
//! approval's whole life — opened, decided, refused — extends the same chain as
//! the mutations it was about, and "who changed this plan and who signed it off"
//! is one walk.
//!
//! **One thing stays outside this rail**, and one thing that used to be listed
//! here no longer does. The refused attempt's `deny` record is written by
//! `crate::infra::approval::record_denial` — not by this module, because the
//! subject of that record is an attempt rather than a unit — but it is written
//! **inside the judgement transaction**, like everything else here. This doc
//! used to say it needed a second transaction "because the judgement's rolls
//! back with the refusal"; that premise was false (the judgement returns the
//! refusal as `Ok` and the transaction commits), and it is corrected in
//! `crate::infra::approval`'s Ruling 1. What genuinely stays outside is the
//! machine-driven voids —
//! [`void_pending_for_plan`] and [`void_pending_for_subject`] — write no record
//! at all: no principal acted, the mutation that triggered them has already
//! written its own record on the same segment at the same instant, and
//! `actor_principal_id` is a non-null column precisely so it is never a
//! synthetic. Neither takes a stamp, and neither is a decision.

///   the window's canonical scope key, and the argument for that was symmetry across
///   the two stores D-158 requires to agree. The read was the defect: a window unit
///   is opened by the arm that writes **nothing** (D-62), so the row it read did not
///   exist and this function answered `CorruptRow` — a 500 — for every read of a
///   pending cancellation's unit. Encoding the plan is what makes both stores spell
///   one act one way *and* makes the aggregate answerable without the subject
///   existing.
/// * `policy` — the ref is a bare version number and names **no** aggregate id,
///   because the aggregate is the tenant's single threshold policy. No read
///   happens and none can fail; the ref is not even parsed here, since which
///   version it is has no bearing on which segment the record extends.
/// * `price_unit` — **no writer, so no ref format is decided for it**, and it
///   therefore inherits the parse rather than getting an arm of its own. That is
///   deliberate and it is what the store already required: D-158 makes every
///   declared kind *storable*, `tests/sqlite_approval_repo.rs`'s
///   `every_subject_kind_d158_declares_is_storable_on_the_mirror` opens one to prove
///   it, and refusing the kind here would have made that unit unwritable — the trail
///   append is inside the same transaction. **A divergence to report rather than
///   fix**: `entity::approval`'s column doc says a price unit's ref is a bare
///   `price_id`, which this parse cannot read, so the slice that gives the kind a
///   writer owes this arm a decision.
///
/// **No read, and therefore no `Db` failure.** It took a runner and a scope while the
