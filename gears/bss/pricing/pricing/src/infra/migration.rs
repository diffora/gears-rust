//! The `MigrationScheduler` of §1.7 — scheduling, cancellation, and the
//! Subscriptions execution handshake (`inst-ms-api`, `inst-ms-deltas`,
//! `inst-ms-emit`, `inst-ms-return`, `inst-mst-*`, `inst-mg-target`,
//! `inst-mg-idem`, `inst-mg-cancel`, D-36, D-49, D-65).
//!
//! The catalog **schedules**; Subscriptions **executes**. Nothing here mutates a
//! subscription and nothing re-opens a posted period — the whole of this
//! module's output is one `pricing_migration` row and one
//! `PlanMigrationScheduled` event.
//!
//! # Three of this slice's inputs have no producer in the built system
//!
//! Stated once here rather than rediscovered at each call site, and every one is
//! reported rather than smoothed over:
//!
//! 1. **The in-scope subscription set.** The catalog holds no subscriptions and
//!    the D-79 Subscriptions lane has no client — the same absence D-182 already
//!    makes normative one flow over. So [`schedule`] analyses an **empty**
//!    subject set, and [`MigrationSchedule::subjects_unresolved`] says so. That
//!    matters more than it looks: an empty delta report otherwise reads as "no
//!    subscriber has a problem" when the truth is "no subscriber could be
//!    enumerated", and those are opposite facts for an operator about to confirm.
//! 2. **The Contracts lock registry** (`inst-cl-source`). See
//!    [`crate::domain::migration_delta`] — absent, so every subscription reads
//!    locked and is excluded.
//! 3. **Entitlement grant totals** (`inst-md-entitlements`) — **the target half
//!    is built and only the subject half is missing.** This
//!    entry read "there is no grant store in this gear at all" until then, which
//!    was true of the branch D-252 was written on and false at the merge:
//!    `pricing_plan.entitlement_grants` landed the same day in a concurrent
//!    strand (`pricing_plan`, D-41), and [`target_shape`] was discarding a
//!    set its own `plan_repo::load_current` call already returned.
//!    [`grant_totals`] now maps it, and D-253 decides the two halves the mapping
//!    could not settle by itself — flags as `1`/`0` under a namespaced key, and
//!    the **minimum** across a phased plan's phases.
//!
//!    **The class is still silent end to end, and now for one reason instead of
//!    two**: source-side totals come from Subscriptions, which has no crate here
//!    and enumerates nothing. That is case 1 above, not a second gap.
//!
//! What is readable today is the target's **boundary coverage**, its **add-on
//! rule set** and now its **grant totals**; all three want a subject set.
//!
//! # Why scheduling opens no approval unit
//!
//! Retirement is an always-material act (D-109) and migration scheduling is not:
//! §5 types it `plan × migrate` and
//! [`crate::domain::materiality::triggers`] registers no migration trigger.
//! Scheduling therefore pins no subject and adds no fourth copy of the
//! `re_derive` assembly D-247 made normative. Were a later decision to make it
//! material, the schedule's subject is the **published** source revision — which
//! is exactly D-247's class, and `current_revision_shape` is what it must reuse.

///    Re-validating first would let a retry fail because the world moved after
///    the original succeeded, which is precisely what an idempotency key exists
///    to prevent.
///
///    **A replay is a replay only if it carries the request the key was spent
///    on**, and that is asked here, in this arm, before the stored record is
///    returned. An arm that loaded by `migration_id` and returned would answer a
///    second `POST` under a spent id naming a *different* plan pair or subscriber
///    scope with `200` and the other pair's schedule, discarding the arriving
///    request outright. The store-side comparison in

///    before `insert_or_load` is ever called, so what the store catches is only
///    the loser of two concurrent creates under one id. Both doors answer
///    `IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH` (409).
///
///    The comparison is `migration_repo::StatedRequest`, which is public for this
///    seam: `source_plan_id`, `target_plan_id` and `scope`. `effective_at` is
///    stated and deliberately **outside** it — two contract pins read a differing
///    effective date as the same replay, and `StatedRequest`'s doc records the
///    reading of `inst-ms-api` behind that and whose decision it would be to flip.
///    `announced_at`, `source_revision`, `created_at`, `created_by` and
///    `delta_report` are minted or derived at commit time and differ between a
///    call and its retry by construction.
///
///    **This is still the gear's only idempotent create path that stores no
///    request digest**, and that part of review Z4-5 stands. Its two siblings both
///    carry one and made two *different* deliberate choices: the shared gate
///    (`idempotent::guarded`) stores the hash **and compares** it; the repricing
///    run (`pricing_bulk_operation`) stores it and does **not** compare, answering
///    the frozen run, with the reason written at `api::rest::repricing_runs`.
///    `pricing_migration` has no digest column at all — the grep for
///    `request_hash` across `src/` returns `pricing_idempotency_dedup` and
///    `pricing_bulk_operation` and nothing else.
///
///    What that costs is now only the **forensic** half, and the divergence
///    comparison is the reason: `pricing_migration` stores the four fields a
///    caller states as columns the append-only trigger then freezes, so a replay
///    is compared against the stored record exactly rather than by a
///    collision-bounded digest, with no new column. What a digest would add over
///    that is a record of the body a request carried — after the fact, nothing on
///    the row says whether the schedule was created from the body its requester
///    sent. Adding it is a schema act, not a repair — a column, a migration, the
///    frozen migration lists on both engines and the two schema suites — and the
///    design set's own cross-reference is misleading about it:
///    `design/11-lifecycle.md` points this create at *"Slice 12's `run_id`
///    pattern"* and `design/12-operator-efficiency.md` says that pattern *"reuses
///    the Foundation's dedup machinery"*, which is the row that has a digest.
///    Whoever closes it should close the document and the column together.
///
///    **A second-order note on the same arm**, because the remedy is not obvious
///    from a `200`: the replay read filters by id and **not by state**, so a
///    `cancelled` or `completed` `migration_id` is permanently spent and a
///    re-post under it returns the terminal row. That is `inst-ms-api`'s "never a
///    second one" read literally and is the right reading of a client-supplied
///    at-most-once key — the remedy is a new id.
/// 2. **The cheap total refusals** — distinct plans, then the target's lifecycle
///    state (`inst-mg-target`). Both are permanent for this world state.
/// 3. **The notice period** (D-49), measured from *this* commit as the
///    announcement instant.
/// 4. **The deltas** (`inst-ms-deltas`), and the refusal if any block: an
///    unresolved blocking delta **never persists a schedule** (§7), so this must
///    precede the insert.
/// 5. **The row, the event, the record** — in that order and one transaction, so
