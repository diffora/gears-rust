//! What refers to a plan, read for the retirement guard (`inst-re-references`).
//!
//! `domain::retirement::ReferenceReport` decides whether a retirement may
//! proceed; this module is where the report's contents come from. The split is
//! the usual one — the judgement is a pure function with cases of its own, and
//! the reads are here because they are queries against a world the domain layer
//! may not know about.
//!
//! # Two blocking classes, and the narrowing that makes them true
//!
//! **Bundle components** ride `idx_pricing_bundle_component_plan`
//! (`(tenant_id, component_plan_id)`), the index `m20260802_000025` added for
//! exactly this shape of question — `infra::bundle::referencing_markets` asks its
//! forward half. Only a bundle's **current published revision** counts, for
//! D-212's reason restated one direction over: `pricing_bundle_component` is
//! revision-scoped, so one plan may appear in several revisions of one bundle,
//! and a draft revision's component set is nobody's truth yet. Blocking a
//! retirement on a composition no consumer can resolve would refuse an operator
//! an act nothing depends on.
//!
//! **Add-on price-override targets** are the `pricing_plan_addon_rule` rows whose
//! `price_override_ref` names a **price row of the retiring plan**. The column
//! holds a price id rather than a plan id, so the question is asked in two steps:
//! the retiring plan's price ids, then the rules pointing at any of them. Same
//! revision narrowing, same reason.
//!
//! # What this module deliberately cannot see, and it is not an omission
//!
//! **`allowedChangeTargets` (D-24) has no store in this gear.** Nothing persists
//! it — no column, no table, no projection — so the warning class
//! `WarningReferenceKind::AllowedChangeTarget` exists in the domain vocabulary
//! and has no producer here. That is reported rather than smoothed over: the
//! alternative is a dry-run that silently claims no plan lists the retiree as a
//! change target when the truth is that nobody ever wrote it down. The class
//! stays in the domain type because the refusal it belongs to is decided, and a
//! producer landing later needs no change to the judgement.
//!
//! **Overlay targets (D-31) are not read here either.** `pricing_price_overlay`
//! carries them inside a `jsonb` `target_ref` of shape `{"plans": [...]}`, which
//! is answerable only by scanning the tenant's published overlays and matching in
//! Rust — a different cost profile from the two indexed probes above, and one
//! that belongs with the surface that decides how much of it to pay. Also
//! reported.
//!
//! Both absences are **warnings**, never blocks, so nothing this module cannot
//! see can make a retirement wrongly succeed: the two classes it does read are
//! exactly the two that refuse.

/// One retirement, composed and committed or composed and submitted, in the

///
/// # The order, and why each step is where it is
///
/// 1. **Compose** — the same read-and-decide the dry-run runs, inside the
///    transaction that writes, so nothing an operator approved can have moved
///    behind the decision.
/// 2. **Refuse on a blocking reference** (`inst-re-references`) before anything
///    else. It is permanent for this world state and names an act the operator
///    must perform first, so asking a reviewer to decide a retirement that
///    cannot commit would waste the one thing D-109 is spending: a second
///    principal's attention.
/// 3. **An approved unit decides before the evaluator is asked**, the
///    supersession's rule and for its reason.
/// 4. **The verdict is fixed** — `inst-mat-registered` registers
///    [`Trigger::PlanRetirement`] (D-109), so no threshold policy is read and
///    none could change the answer. Retirement is material because of what it
///    **is**: irreversible, sales-stopping, and cancelling on every unoccupied
///    key at once — which is exactly the act D-62 made two-person for a *single*
///    window.
/// 5. **The registry request**, fail closed, after every refusal (D-156).
/// 6. **The flip**, then the windows, then the ref, the event and the record.
///
/// # What this function does **not** do, and it is not an oversight
///
/// **It does not abandon the plan's open draft revision.** `inst-rt-cancel`
/// requires that (D-145) and it is owed. `PlanRepo::abandon_draft` opens a
/// transaction of its own, so calling it here would nest one; the honest fix is
/// to extract its body into an `_on` form the way this file's neighbours are
/// factored, which is a refactor of a shared repository better made deliberately
/// than as a side effect. The gap is **inert rather than unsound**: a retired
/// plan can never publish, and `publish_revision`'s
/// `refuse_unpublishable_predecessor` refuses the draft's publish with
/// `PLAN_RETIRED_NO_SUCCESSOR` — so what survives is a draft nobody can ship,
/// holding a revision number, rather than a path to publishing on a retired
/// plan. Reported in the hand-back.
///
/// **It does not unwind a live cutover unit** (`inst-co-retirement-unwind`,
/// D-05), and this list carried only the paragraph above for as long as it has
/// existed. `inst-rt-cancel` requires the unwind *in the same transaction* as the
/// flip: the predecessor window's `effectiveTo` restored to its recorded
/// pre-cutover value, the scheduled copy and successor cancelled, the unit closed
/// as `unwound`, a merely `submitted` unit voided. Nothing below performs any of
/// it — `cancel_windows_in` acts on `preview.windows`, which is the plan's own
/// window plane judged by `dispose_windows`, and knows nothing about a cutover
/// unit. `tests/sqlite_cutover_unwind.rs` reads all four clauses back off the
/// store after a retirement over a committed cutover and finds every one of them
/// unperformed.
///
/// **One of the four is not merely unbuilt — it is not constructible here**, and
/// that is the part no account carried anywhere. It was **two** until 2026-08-17:
///
/// * *"its recorded pre-cutover value"* named an operand **nothing recorded**, and
///   now names one that is recorded and addressable. The account of the gap was
///   exact — `infra::cutover::commit_cutover` shortens the predecessor through
///   `window_repo::adjust_effective_to`, an in-place `UPDATE` of a table with no
///   before-image column, the act's three events are none of them about the shorten,
///   and the value is not derivable afterwards because `compose_cutover_windows`
///   picks the window `WindowInterval::covers` answers `true` for, which admits an
///   absent end *and* any end strictly after the cutover. What changed is the fourth
///   store: `record_cutover`'s state now carries the shortened window's interval on
///   both sides of the pair, keyed `(scopeKey, effectiveFrom)`, and
///   `audit_repo::for_subject` reads it back under the act's own subject. So an
///   unwind no longer has to guess `None` and hand a plan being retired open-ended
///   coverage it never had.
/// * *"closed as `unwound`"* names a state this machine does not have and the
///   design set does not declare: `05-governance.md` §4's approval state machine
///   and §6's `state` column are both `submitted | approved | rejected | voided`,
///   which is exactly what `chk_pricing_approval_state` admits. Minting a fifth persisted-and-wire
///   token is what **D-204 clause (2)** refuses, on the same reading
///   `domain::retirement::strand_free_disposition` cites one surface over.
///
/// The other three — finding the live unit, cancelling its two scheduled windows,
/// restoring the bound off the trail — **are** constructible today, and building
/// them alone would be worse than building nothing: a predecessor still ending at
/// the cutover with the schedules that were to take over from it gone is precisely
/// the trailing void D-05 rejected its option (a) to avoid, arriving as the result of
/// the fix. So the unwind is one act or none.
///
/// # Two things the unwind must do that reading D-05 does not tell you
///
/// Recorded here, at the site that will build it, rather than left to be rediscovered:
///
/// 1. **Cancel the successor window before restoring the bound, never after.**
///    `window_repo::adjust_effective_to` runs `refuse_overlap` over
///    `OCCUPYING_STATES`, and the successor's `[cutover, …)` sits on the
///    predecessor's own key — so lengthening the predecessor back past the cutover
///    while that window is still `scheduled` is refused `WINDOW_OVERLAP`. The copy
///    does not participate: `inst-co-copy` moves it to a **new generation's** key, so
///    it is on a different plane. The ordering is therefore forced by a rule, not
///    chosen — and it is the reverse of the order D-05's own sentence lists the
///    clauses in.
/// 2. **Re-check `cutover_at > now` inside the unwind's own transaction.** This is
///    the single reachable path to the append-only trigger's refusal
///    (`m20260802_000016` arm 5, `m20260802_000021`'s Postgres twin), and
///    `tests/sqlite_cutover_unwind.rs` pins why every *other* path is unreachable:
///    inside D-05's scope the cutover is approved and not yet effective, so `OLD` is
///    the cutover instant `T > now` and `NEW` is the original bound the cutover
///    shortened, hence `> T > now`; a NULL original bound skips the clause outright.
///    What that argument depends on is `T > now`, and the cutover instant can pass
///    between an operator's decision to retire and this transaction's write. A
///    half-applied unwind — the two schedules cancelled by clause (1) above, the
///    bound not restored because the trigger refused it — is exactly the coverage
///    void D-05 exists to prevent, reached by the fix. So the guard belongs in the
///    same transaction as the writes, and a retirement that finds `T <= now` must
///    refuse the whole act rather than perform part of it.
///
/// What D-05 asks for and **is** already paid is its materiality half: retirement
/// is always material under `Trigger::PlanRetirement` (D-109, unconditional),
/// `MaterialityVerdict` carries no trigger identity, and so a verdict declared
/// under `Trigger::RetirementUnwindingACutover` would be byte-identical. That
/// trigger's zero producers therefore cost nothing observable — which is why the
/// `false` beside it in `domain::materiality::triggers` is honest and why the
/// gap had no symptom for a census to find.
///
/// # Errors

/// own enqueue — `infra::window`, `infra::cutover`, `infra::supersession`,
/// `infra::repricing` — and retirement was the one that did not. Putting it in
/// the repo instead would have double-emitted in all four.
///
/// # The act segment, and why the dedup key needs one
///
/// `price_window_mutation` keys on the **act** rather than on the transition,
/// because `Op::event` maps a schedule *and* an adjustment to one name; the same

/// retirement and the same window cancelled through `DELETE` are two acts, and
/// `{plan}/retirement/{revision}` is the act this one is — the same coordinate
/// [`retirement_unit_ref`] names the approval unit by, passed in from
/// [`retire_in`]'s `subject_ref` rather than re-spelled here.
///
/// **The plan segment leads**, and this sentence used to transpose it. That is not
/// a typo with no consequence: [`retirement_unit_ref`]'s own doc records that
/// `approval_repo::subject_plan` parses the aggregate off the **head** of every

/// **It leads with the act, and it used to lead with the tenant** (Z9-10). The
/// registry is a cross-tenant service whose idempotency is keyed on exactly this
/// string, and this was the one id of the five whose uniqueness rested on a
/// segment of a string built somewhere else: `{tenant}/{subject_ref}`, where the
/// `/retirement/` that told it apart from a publish of the same revision is
/// `approval::retirement_unit_ref`'s to spell and to change. The four siblings all
/// carry a discriminator of their own — `publish.rs`' `{kind_token}/…`,
/// `supersession.rs`' `supersession/…`, `cutover.rs`' `cutover/…`, `window.rs`'
/// `…/{act}` — so this one now does too, and no collision depends on a subject
/// helper keeping a segment it never promised.
///
/// **Re-spelling strands an outstanding pending ref**, which is the same re-freeze
/// question `PublishUnitKind::request_token` carries: a retirement that requested a
/// version under the old id and has not committed will request a *new* handle on
/// its retry, leaving the first assigned and unreferenced. It is stranded, not
/// double-spent — the flip is guarded by `plan_repo::retire_revision`'s own
/// compare-and-swap, not by the handle — and the window is one uncommitted
/// retirement per plan.
