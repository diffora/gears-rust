//! What refers to a plan, read for the retirement guard (`inst-re-references`).
//!
//! `domain::retirement::ReferenceReport` decides whether a retirement may
//! proceed; this module is where the report's contents come from. The split is
//! the usual one — the judgement is a pure function with cases of its own, and
//! the reads are here because they are queries against a world the domain layer
//! may not know about.
//!
//! # Two blocking classes, and the narrowing that makes them true
//!
//! **Bundle components** ride `idx_pricing_bundle_component_plan`
//! (`(tenant_id, component_plan_id)`), the index that exists for exactly this shape
//! of question — `infra::bundle::referencing_markets` asks its
//! forward half. Only a bundle's **current published revision** counts, for
//! D-212's reason restated one direction over: `pricing_bundle_component` is
//! revision-scoped, so one plan may appear in several revisions of one bundle,
//! and a draft revision's component set is nobody's truth yet. Blocking a
//! retirement on a composition no consumer can resolve would refuse an operator
//! an act nothing depends on.
//!
//! **Add-on price-override targets** are the `pricing_plan_addon_rule` rows whose
//! `price_override_ref` names a **price row of the retiring plan**. The column
//! holds a price id rather than a plan id, so the question is asked in two steps:
//! the retiring plan's price ids, then the rules pointing at any of them. Same
//! revision narrowing, same reason.
//!
//! # What this module deliberately cannot see, and it is not an omission
//!
//! **`allowedChangeTargets` (D-24) has no store in this gear.** Nothing persists
//! it — no column, no table, no projection — so the warning class
//! `WarningReferenceKind::AllowedChangeTarget` exists in the domain vocabulary
//! and has no producer here. That is reported rather than smoothed over: the
//! alternative is a dry-run that silently claims no plan lists the retiree as a
//! change target when the truth is that nobody ever wrote it down. The class
//! stays in the domain type because the refusal it belongs to is decided, and a
//! producer landing later needs no change to the judgement.
//!
//! **Overlay targets (D-31) are not read here either.** `pricing_price_overlay`
//! carries them inside a `jsonb` `target_ref` of shape `{"plans": [...]}`, which
//! is answerable only by scanning the tenant's published overlays and matching in
//! Rust — a different cost profile from the two indexed probes above, and one
//! that belongs with the surface that decides how much of it to pay. Also
//! reported.
//!
//! Both absences are **warnings**, never blocks, so nothing this module cannot
//! see can make a retirement wrongly succeed: the two classes it does read are
//! exactly the two that refuse *as references*.
//!
//! Two further things refuse and neither is a reference:
//! [`ensure_no_live_migration_targets`] reads the migration plane and raises
//! `RETIRE_TARGET_OF_MIGRATION`, and `ensure_no_live_cutover` reads the approval
//! plane and raises `RETIRE_OVER_LIVE_CUTOVER` (see that function, and the constant,
//! for why that code is this gear's and not §5's). Both are kept out of
//! [`ReferenceReport`] because their remedies
//! are different acts on different objects, which is what the ladder types apart.
//!
//! The consequence worth stating for both: the **dry-run does not report them**, so
//! a preview can call a plan retirable that the commit then refuses. Closing that
//! means deciding whether a live schedule and a live cutover are further
//! `BlockingReferenceKind`s — which would fold them into `RETIRE_PLAN_REFERENCED`,
//! the thing the ladder deliberately avoids — or whether the preview grows a channel
//! of its own. Not invented here.

///    transaction that writes, so nothing an operator approved can have moved
///    behind the decision.
/// 2. **Refuse on a blocking reference** (`inst-re-references`) before anything
///    else. It is permanent for this world state and names an act the operator
///    must perform first, so asking a reviewer to decide a retirement that
///    cannot commit would waste the one thing D-109 is spending: a second
///    principal's attention.
/// 3. **An approved unit decides before the evaluator is asked**, the
///    supersession's rule and for its reason.
/// 4. **The verdict is fixed** — `inst-mat-registered` registers
///    [`Trigger::PlanRetirement`] (D-109), so no threshold policy is read and
///    none could change the answer. Retirement is material because of what it
///    **is**: irreversible, sales-stopping, and cancelling on every unoccupied
///    key at once — which is exactly the act D-62 made two-person for a *single*
///    window.
/// 5. **The registry request**, fail closed, after every refusal (D-156).
/// 6. **The flip**, then the windows, then the ref, the event and the record.
///
/// # What this function does **not** do, and it is not an oversight
///
/// **It does not abandon the plan's open draft revision.** `inst-rt-cancel`
/// requires that (D-145) and it is owed. `PlanRepo::abandon_draft` opens a
/// transaction of its own, so calling it here would nest one; the honest fix is
/// to extract its body into an `_on` form the way this file's neighbours are
/// factored, which is a refactor of a shared repository better made deliberately
/// than as a side effect. The gap is **inert rather than unsound**: a retired
/// plan can never publish, and `publish_revision`'s
/// `refuse_unpublishable_predecessor` refuses the draft's publish with
/// `PLAN_RETIRED_NO_SUCCESSOR` — so what survives is a draft nobody can ship,
/// holding a revision number, rather than a path to publishing on a retired
/// plan. Reported in the hand-back.
///
/// **It does not unwind a live cutover unit** (`inst-co-retirement-unwind`,
/// D-05) — it **refuses** while one stands. `inst-rt-cancel` requires the unwind
/// *in the same transaction* as the flip: the predecessor window's `effectiveTo`
/// restored to its recorded pre-cutover value, the scheduled copy and successor
/// cancelled, the unit closed as `unwound`, a merely `submitted` unit voided.
/// Nothing below performs any of it — `cancel_windows_in` acts on
/// `preview.windows`, which is the plan's own window plane judged by
/// `dispose_windows`, and knows nothing about a cutover unit. So
/// [`ensure_no_live_cutover`] refuses the whole act instead, and that function
/// carries why refusing is the arm taken and what it costs.
///
/// **One of the four is not merely unbuilt — it is not constructible here**, which
/// is the part an account of this gap most easily leaves out:
///
/// * *"its recorded pre-cutover value"* named an operand **nothing recorded**, and
///   now names one that is recorded and addressable. The account of the gap was
///   exact — `infra::cutover::commit_cutover` shortens the predecessor through
///   `window_repo::adjust_effective_to`, an in-place `UPDATE` of a table with no
///   before-image column, the act's three events are none of them about the shorten,
///   and the value is not derivable afterwards because `compose_cutover_windows`
///   picks the window `WindowInterval::covers` answers `true` for, which admits an
///   absent end *and* any end strictly after the cutover. What changed is the fourth
///   store: `record_cutover`'s state now carries the shortened window's interval on
///   both sides of the pair, keyed `(scopeKey, effectiveFrom)`, and
///   `audit_repo::for_subject` reads it back under the act's own subject. So an
///   unwind no longer has to guess `None` and hand a plan being retired open-ended
///   coverage it never had.
/// * *"closed as `unwound`"* names a state **this machine** does not have, and the
///   store is the whole of what is missing: `05-governance.md` §4 declares the
///   fifth token, §6's `state` column carries it and `inst-as-unwind` declares the
///   `approved → unwound` transition — all three since **D-333**. What
///   does not exist is the persisted half: `chk_pricing_approval_state` still admits
///   only `submitted | approved | rejected | voided`, and `ApprovalState` has no
///   variant. That is ordinary build work in this crate, on a decision that is
///   already taken.
///
///   The design set **does** declare the token and D-204 clause (2) does not refuse
///   minting it. Reading it the other way is the error worth guarding against: a
///   mirroring obligation with no target reads to the next author as a blocked
///   external dependency, which is D-333's own account of why it corrected the
///   same sentence in the register. `infra::cutover::record_cutover` and
///   `infra::grandfather` describe this world correctly and are the wording to
///   follow.
///
/// The other three — finding the live unit, cancelling its two scheduled windows,
/// restoring the bound off the trail — **are** constructible today, and building
/// them alone would be worse than building nothing: a predecessor still ending at
/// the cutover with the schedules that were to take over from it gone is precisely
/// the trailing void D-05 rejected its option (a) to avoid, arriving as the result of
/// the fix. So the unwind is one act or none.
///
/// # Two things the unwind must do that reading D-05 does not tell you
///
/// Recorded here, at the site that will build it, rather than left to be rediscovered:
///
/// 1. **Cancel the successor window before restoring the bound, never after.**
///    `window_repo::adjust_effective_to` runs `refuse_overlap` over
///    `OCCUPYING_STATES`, and the successor's `[cutover, …)` sits on the
///    predecessor's own key — so lengthening the predecessor back past the cutover
///    while that window is still `scheduled` is refused `WINDOW_OVERLAP`. The copy
///    does not participate: `inst-co-copy` moves it to a **new generation's** key, so
///    it is on a different plane. The ordering is therefore forced by a rule, not
///    chosen — and it is the reverse of the order D-05's own sentence lists the
///    clauses in.
/// 2. **Re-check `cutover_at > now` inside the unwind's own transaction.** This is
///    the single reachable path to the append-only trigger's refusal
///    (`pricing_price_window` arm 5, `pricing_price_window`'s Postgres twin), and
///    `tests/sqlite_cutover_unwind.rs` pins why every *other* path is unreachable:
///    inside D-05's scope the cutover is approved and not yet effective, so `OLD` is
///    the cutover instant `T > now` and `NEW` is the original bound the cutover
///    shortened, hence `> T > now`; a NULL original bound skips the clause outright.
///    What that argument depends on is `T > now`, and the cutover instant can pass
///    between an operator's decision to retire and this transaction's write. A
///    half-applied unwind — the two schedules cancelled by clause (1) above, the
///    bound not restored because the trigger refused it — is exactly the coverage
///    void D-05 exists to prevent, reached by the fix. So the guard belongs in the
///    same transaction as the writes, and a retirement that finds `T <= now` must
///    refuse the whole act rather than perform part of it.
///
/// What D-05 asks for and **is** already paid is its materiality half: retirement
/// is always material under `Trigger::PlanRetirement` (D-109, unconditional),
/// `MaterialityVerdict` carries no trigger identity, and so a verdict declared
/// under `Trigger::RetirementUnwindingACutover` would be byte-identical. That
/// trigger's zero producers therefore cost nothing observable — which is why the

/// on each window, *"each cancellation emits `PriceWindowCancelled` and drives its
/// cache-eviction path"* — and *"marking-invalid without the event is
/// forbidden (consumers would keep warm caches)"*. Inline in [`retire_in`] this
/// was a bare [`window_repo::transition`] loop with a comment asserting the
/// second clause and no code performing it. That was inert only because D-182's
/// fail-closed presence map keeps the list empty; the day the D-79 lane lands,
/// every window it condemns would be marked invalid with no event — the exact
/// shape the instruction forbids, arriving green.
///
/// # The enqueue is the caller's, and that is this crate's settled arrangement
///
/// [`window_repo::transition`] enqueues nothing, deliberately: it is also the
/// activation sweep's edge (`jobs::window_activation`), and the sweep's two
/// events are `PriceWindowActivated`/`PriceWindowExpired` — a store that emitted
/// per edge would have to know which of §5's surfaces called it, which is
/// [`NewOutboxEvent::price_window_mutation`]'s own argument for taking the event
/// as an argument. So every window-mutating **service** pairs the flip with its
/// own enqueue — `infra::window`, `infra::cutover`, `infra::supersession`,
/// `infra::repricing` — and retirement was the one that did not. Putting it in
/// the repo instead would have double-emitted in all four.
///
/// # The act segment, and why the dedup key needs one
///
/// `price_window_mutation` keys on the **act** rather than on the transition,
/// because `Op::event` maps a schedule *and* an adjustment to one name; the same
/// reasoning applies here in the other direction. A window cancelled by a
/// retirement and the same window cancelled through `DELETE` are two acts, and
/// `{plan}/retirement/{revision}` is the act this one is — the same coordinate
/// [`retirement_unit_ref`] names the approval unit by, passed in from
/// [`retire_in`]'s `subject_ref` rather than re-spelled here.
///
/// **The plan segment leads**, and transposing it is not a typo with no
/// consequence: [`retirement_unit_ref`]'s own doc records that
/// `approval_repo::subject_plan` parses the aggregate off the **head** of every
/// ref, that the column's `CHECK`s admit any text, and that putting the act first
/// reads back as a `CorruptRow` from inside the approval plane. A reader who takes
/// this rendering as the shape and builds the next act's ref to match it lands
/// exactly there.
///
/// # It is `pub`, and that is the D-182 posture rather than a testability leak
///
/// [`retire_in`] cannot reach this loop at all today: `compose_preview` hard-wires
/// [`PresenceMap::fail_closed`], so every window is kept and the condemned list is
/// empty. A rule that runs only once a lane **nobody has built** starts answering
/// is a rule no suite driving the orchestrator can arm — which is precisely how
/// the missing event stayed green. So the flow is addressable on its own, and
/// `sqlite_retirement_unit` arms it against hand-built verdicts.
///
/// # Errors
/// [`DomainError::Internal`] when a transition or an enqueue fails; a window that
/// has moved since the preview read it surfaces as its own repository refusal.
