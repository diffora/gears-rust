//! Unit tests for `WindowService` — the pure arithmetic the transaction wraps.
//!
//! The service is exercised end to end by `tests/sqlite_window_service.rs` and
//! `tests/rest_windows.rs`, which need a real store. What belongs here is what needs
//! none: the classification D-62's control keys on, and the answer the controlled arm
//! hands back. Both are decided from a `Planned` and nothing else, so a test that
//! stood up a database to reach them would be asserting about the database.
//!
//! **`Op::registered_trigger`'s `Adjust` arm has no other test, and it is why this
//! file exists.** Over HTTP the arm is shadowed: the coverage rules refuse every
//! shorten a caller can compose — the interior check where the shortened window has a
//! successor, D-182's fail-closed floor where it does not — so
//! `tests/rest_windows.rs` can only pin *that*
//! ordering (`a_shortening_patch_is_refused_by_the_coverage_rules_before_it_can_open_a_unit`)
//! and never the classification itself. Here the classification is the whole subject,
//! which is what keeps a shadowed guard from being an unasserted one.
