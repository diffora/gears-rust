//! Unit tests for the horizon door's judgement of D-04's span.
//!
//! The door's storage half is exercised end to end by
//! `tests/rest_grandfather_until.rs`, which needs a real cutover, a real approval
//! and a real store. What belongs here is the one question that needs none and
//! that no HTTP case can reach honestly: **which way this act can move the bound
//! `refuse_horizon_span_uncovered` measures**.
//!
//! The claim the module doc makes is asymmetric, and an asymmetric claim needs both
//! sides asserted or it is an assumption with a test next to it:
//!
//! * a **finite** horizon moved earlier shrinks the span, so coverage that
//!   satisfied the bound still does — and the smallest interesting shape is a key
//!   whose coverage stops *exactly* at the old floor, where a rule that forgot to
//!   recompute the floor from the proposed horizon would still pass and a rule that
//!   recomputed it wrongly would not;
//! * a horizon set on an **indefinite** generation crosses from the arm that never
//!   consults W6's margin to the arm that requires it, so `inst-gs-bound` on a plan
//!   that authors no recurring frequency is the one shape where this act can newly
//!   strand what D-04 protects.
//!
//! Each refusal is paired with the positive control that differs from it in exactly
//! the operand under test, so a guard that refused everything could not pass.
