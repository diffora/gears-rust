//! The one transaction the at-most-once contract requires: claim, mutate,
//! render, record, commit.
//!
//! `idempotency_repo`'s module doc states the contract in as many words and this
//! module is what makes it satisfiable: [`IdempotencyGate::claim`] and
//! [`IdempotencyGate::record_response`] **MUST** run inside the same transaction
//! as the mutation they guard, because "split across two transactions the
//! guarantee inverts: the claim commits while the mutation does not, and every
//! retry of a request that never happened is answered 'already done', forever."
//!
//! # Why the seam is here and not in the handler or the repository
//!
//! Neither of the other two candidates can hold that transaction.
//!
//! - `PlanRepo::create_draft` runs through the repository's **private**
//!   connection, which a caller cannot borrow and cannot make join a transaction
//!   it opened. `PriceRepo::create_draft` opens its **own**, and the toolkit
//!   refuses `Db::conn()` inside an open transaction, so it cannot be nested in
//!   one either. Both now have runner-taking forms —
//!   [`plan_repo::create_draft_on`] and [`price_repo::create_draft_on`] — which
//!   are *extracted* from those methods rather than copied, so the guarded path
//!   and the direct one issue the same statements.
//! - A handler must not become the transaction owner regardless. `api/rest` is
//!   where DTOs and the authz gate live; a handler holding a `DbTx` would put
//!   rollback semantics and the commit boundary into the transport layer, and
//!   two handlers would spell one contract twice.
//!
//! So it sits beside [`crate::infra::publish`], which is the other thing in this
//! crate that owns a transaction and composes repositories inside it, and it is
//! the answer to that module's "Idempotency is deliberately not wired here".
//!
//! [`plan_repo::create_draft_on`]: crate::infra::storage::repo::plan_repo::create_draft_on
//! [`price_repo::create_draft_on`]: crate::infra::storage::repo::price_repo::create_draft_on
//!
//! # Why the caller supplies the renderer
//!
//! **The recorded body must be the body that was actually sent.** A replay hands
//! back a stored status and a stored body verbatim; if this module rendered
//! something of its own — the domain value, a summary, anything but the response
//! — a replay would answer the second caller something the first caller never
//! received, which defeats the only reason the response is stored at all.
//!
//! The renderer is a **closure** rather than a type parameter naming a view,
//! because DE0202 forbids `infra` from importing a `*Dto` / `*Response` /
//! `*Query` type and the response types live in `api::rest` by DE0201. A closure
//! carries no type name across that boundary, so the body is produced by the
//! layer that owns the wire shape and this module never learns what it is.
//!
//! # What a caller can be told
//!
//! This is the first path in the gear that can put `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_IN_FLIGHT`
//! on the wire. D-143 minted that code *because* "the surface layer had nothing
//! to answer a client with"; the outcome existed and the answer did not. Both
//! that refusal and `IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH` come back through the single
//! [`repo_failure`] ladder as the 409s they already map to — this module invents
//! no status and no code.
