//! Cloning a plan into a new draft (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §3
//! `algo-clone`, `inst-cl-copy`, `inst-cl-resets`, `inst-cl-discount`,
//! `inst-cl-draft`, `inst-cl-windows`; D-19, D-264, D-268, D-269).
//!
//! The clone copies **configuration** and nothing else. What separates the two
//! is not a list to memorize: configuration is what an author wrote, and
//! everything left behind is *lifecycle state* — where the plan got to, not what
//! it is. Windows, grandfathered generations and superseded history are all the
//! second kind, and `inst-cl-resets` says so in the same breath for all three.
//!
//! # Both cutover-made eligibility classes are lifecycle state (D-268)
//!
//! `inst-cl-resets` excludes `existing_grandfathered` rows *because* copying
//! them under its own reset would collapse two rows onto one canonical scope
//! key. **The identical collapse happens for `new_subscriptions_only`**, and the
//! clause named only the first class. Both are made by a cutover rather than
//! authored, and on a clone the second is meaningless twice over: every
//! subscription on a brand-new plan is new. So both are excluded, and each is
//! reported on the receipt.
//!
//! The consequence is that the eligibility reset itself now has **no operand**:
//! every row that reaches [`reset_key`] already carries `all_subscriptions`,
//! because the only two classes that could carry anything else are excluded
//! first. It is kept as a structural fence beside `Cohort::None` and
//! `grandfather_until` (D-266), not as behaviour a test can prove.
//!
//! # A clone of a bundle is a bundle (D-269)
//!
//! §3's copy set predates Slice 8 and names none of the bundle tables, while
//! `plan_repo::open_revision` copies the composition as one of the plan's child
//! tables — *a bundle rides its plan's revisions*. The two paths that reproduce
//! a plan disagreed, and this one produced a plan holding a bundle's price rows
//! and none of its composition. It now copies: a **new `bundle_id`**
//! (`pricing_bundle.plan_id` is unique per plan), and the components and
//! rev-share groups under it. `bundle_component.component_plan_id` names
//! **other** plans and is carried unchanged — those are different plans, not the
//! clone's phases, and the phase remap has nothing to do with them.
//!
//! # The phase remap is the whole difficulty, and it has three sites
//!
//! Phase rows are copied under **new** `phase_id`s (D-19), so every reference to
//! the old ids has to move with them. There are exactly three:
//!
//! 1. the phase rows' own `converts_to_phase_id` chain;
//! 2. the `phase` axis of every copied price row's canonical scope key;
//! 3. **the keys of the D-41 `entitlement_grants.perPhase` map.**
//!
//! The third is the one a review found missing (C-7): the map is
//! keyed *by* `phase_id`, so an unremapped clone published a grant set pointing
//! at phases that existed only in the source, and its first publish failed
//! `GRANT_SET_PHASE_UNKNOWN` on dangling keys. `AddonRule` carries no phase and
//! the descriptor set carries no phase, so those two are copies rather than
//! remaps — checked rather than assumed.
//!
//! # Three clauses of §3 have no operand in this gear, and are named rather than
//! written
//!
//! Writing a guard for any of them would be a rule that can never fire, which
//! this program has spent a day removing:
//!
//! - **`pricing_plan_grant` is not copied because it does not exist.** The copy
//!   set names it, and it is *Slice 10's* credit-grant table (D-52) — a different
//!   object from Slice 6's `entitlement_grants` column, carrying `category`,
//!   `applicability`, `drawdownPriority` and the `source ∈ {authored,
//!   compiled_allowance}` lineage. It is unbuilt, and it sits inside the
//!   `inst-ac-*` chunk D-177 blocks. So **D-130's rule — a `compiled_allowance`
//!   grant is recompiled at the clone's own publish rather than copied — has
//!   nothing to range over**, and the arm that would implement it is not here.
//! - **Contract locks are not copied because this gear stores none.** They live
//!   in the Contracts registry, which D-251 records as absent; nothing on a plan
//!   or a price row is a lock for this code to skip.
//! - **`discountRef` copies unconditionally.** `inst-cl-discount` drops it unless
//!   it "still resolves to a registered instrument", and `pricing_plan_addon_rule`
//!   already records `inst-dr-referential` as **not buildable**: there is no
//!   instrument registry in this workspace to resolve against. A
//!   drop-if-unresolved arm could never fire, so the ref rides along with the
//!   rest of the row's content.
//!
//! # The clone is an ordinary draft
//!
//! `inst-cl-draft`: no rule reads `cloned_from`, the content pin does not frame
//! it, and the clone's first publish takes the full pipeline and an approval like
//! any other first publish (G1). This module therefore performs **no validation
//! of its own** — it authors a draft, and the publish path judges it. In
//! particular the clone is expected to be *unpublishable* on arrival, because
//! `inst-cl-windows` leaves its billable rows without coverage; that is reported
//! rather than prevented.

/// A separate source scope could not read the source's own children, and the
/// split turned a loud denial into a silent, empty clone.

/// One scope, so an id-shaped answer this gear cannot honour is refused at the

/// take: a bare connection satisfies `DBRunner`, so stating the requirement in
/// prose left it to whoever read the prose. This function writes a whole plan
/// subtree, and half of one committed by autocommit is the failure the paragraph
/// below is about.
///
/// **And there is deliberately no wrapper that opens one.** A method holding a
/// `DBProvider` and opening its own transaction is *silently nested* when called
/// from inside another one: `Db::in_transaction` does not consult the task-local
/// `IN_TX`, so the inner transaction commits on its own and the outer rollback
/// cannot reach it. Such a wrapper is safe only by accident — if its first
