//! The background plane: its supervision, its leases, and the port its jobs are
//! handed.
//!
//! # The three claims here, and why they are one file
//!
//! Z10-12 recorded that nothing tested the scheduling plane at all — every job body
//! was covered and the code deciding *when and under what lease a body runs* was
//! not. Three defects lived in that gap: a guard dropped rather than released
//! (halving a cadence), a panic invisible until shutdown, and the `with_metrics`
//! attachment. The first two are asserted below without a database; the other two
//! claims need one, which is why they were left to their own task and land here now.
//!
//! What still has no case is `serve`'s own `select!` — the arms are covered through
//! [`BssPricingGear::exited_first`], but reaching `serve` needs a whole
//! [`PricingRuntime`], and a runtime needs a PEP, a registry and eight API states.
//! The wiring decisions each ticker used to make inside `tokio::spawn` were moved
//! out to named functions for exactly that reason.
//!
//! # The background plane's supervision — what happens when a ticker dies
//!
//! `serve` spawns three tickers and, until 2026-08-11, awaited their handles
//! **only after** cancellation. A panic on tick 1 therefore left the gear serving
//! traffic with `serve` still `Ok(())`, and the only trace was a `warn` emitted
//! whenever the process finally stopped.
//!
//! That is not cosmetic here. `serve`'s own doc says the warm re-drive is what
//! resolves a pending `CatalogVersion` handle — without it `pricing_read_model`
//! stays empty and no version ever becomes pin-eligible — and the two Criticals
//! `readmodel_warm` raises cannot fire, because the task that raises them is the
//! dead one.

/// # The seam is the real adapter, and that is deliberate
///
/// This week a harness held a **no-op metrics seam** under a comment claiming the
/// real adapter, so a production counter was unobservable in every test by
/// construction. So this case takes no spy: `MetricsHarness` binds
/// `PricingMetricsMeter` — the same type `init()` builds — to a real
/// `SdkMeterProvider` with an in-memory exporter, and the assertion reads the
/// **exported** stream by instrument name and label. The `alarm` label value is
/// transcribed rather than taken from `PricingAlarm::as_str`, for
/// `readmodel_warm_tests`' reason: it is the string an operator's runbook greps for.
///
/// The seed is one pending ref an hour old against the 300s `commit_overdue`
/// threshold, never observed committed — §3.6's predicate exactly, and the pass is
/// the only thing that can raise it.
