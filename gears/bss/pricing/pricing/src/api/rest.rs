//! REST surface.
//!
//! Every route is mounted under the gear's service prefix,
//! `/bss-pricing/v1/{resource}`, with actions as sub-resource segments (D-140),
//! and every collection surface paginates with an opaque cursor (D-125).
//!
//! # The read shape, and the three families that still deviate from it
//!
//! **The pattern is the approvals pair**: a record family offers a
//! cursor-paginated `GET` on its collection *and* a `GET` on one member by id, so a
//! caller who holds an id never pages a tenant's whole set to reach one row, and a
//! caller who holds none can find what the server minted. It is recorded here
//! rather than left implicit because the alternative is what review finding Z13-9
//! found: nine families, each missing a *different* half, and no statement anywhere
//! of which half a tenth family owes.
//!
//! Complete pairs: **approvals**, **plans**, **migrations**, **bundles**,
//! **price overlays**, **price rows**. The deviations, each with the reason it
//! is one:
//!
//! * **price windows** — `GET /price-windows` lists (narrowable to one
//!   `price_id`); `/price-windows/{windowId}` is `PATCH` + `DELETE`. Same shape as
//!   price rows, mitigated the same way: the `price_id` filter is the practical
//!   by-id read.
//! * **repricing runs** and **bulk imports** — the mirror image: each has a by-id
//!   `GET` and no collection read. Deliberate rather than pending. Both are
//!   addressed by a **client-supplied** key (`run_id`, the import's client key), so
//!   a caller that opened a run already holds the id it needs, and neither is a
//!   catalog object an operator browses.
//!
//! * **customer-group memberships** — `GET /customer-groups/{group}/members`
//!   lists; `PATCH …/members/{id}` and `POST …/members/{payerId}/move` address a
//!   member by id and there is no `GET …/members/{id}`. The price-row deviation's
//!   exact shape, and it carries the same mitigation: D-125's cursor pair plus a
//!   `payer_id` filter, so the filtered page is the practical by-id read. Without
//!   the filter and the pagination the deviation has no mitigation at all, against
//!   this module's own opening sentence — and a mitigation stated only inside an
//!   `If-Match` parameter doc at `customer_groups.rs` is one no reader of this
//!   statement finds.
//!
//! Two statements a later surface should be held to: a family's list read owes
//! `limit`, `cursor` and its filters as **declared** query parameters — bound by
//! `module_test`'s `every_query_reading_route_declares_the_parameters_it_reads`,
//! which was written because a paginated route declaring none of its parameters
//! cannot be paged by a generated client at all — and a by-id read is not
//! satisfied by a mutating route at the same path, which is how three of the six
//! deviations above came to look like pairs in a route census.
//!
//! # Records this surface does not serve, and the shape the list above has no
//! entry for
//!
//! The deviation list is organised entirely around *which read half a family
//! owes*, so four findings from a CRUD census had nowhere to be
//! written down. They are here rather than nowhere, because a reader who greps this
//! statement for a table and finds it absent concludes the surface is complete.
//!
//! * **`pricing_catalog_version_ref` is written by every publish door and read by
//!   `GET /catalog-version/refs/{pendingRef}`.** That GET is the one-handle
//!   status: `pending` / `commit_observed` / `committed`, plus the version once
//!   finalize has landed. `GET /catalog-version/frontier` remains the tenant
//!   pin watermark and says nothing about one publish's outcome. The writers
//!   are still `grep -rln "catalog_version_ref_repo::record_pending" src/`.
//! * **`GET /migrated-origin-snapshots/{subscriptionRef}` reads a table no route
//!   writes.** `pricing_snapshot_provenance`'s only writers are
//!   `SynthesisService::synthesize`/`synthesize_in`, and a crate-wide grep for
//!   `.synthesize(` finds callers in **one test file** — no route, and none of the
//!   three mounted jobs (`gated_markets`, `readmodel_warm`, `window_activation`).
//!   The route's own description says *"synthesis then runs as a separate audited
//!   step"* without drawing the conclusion: that step is mounted nowhere, so on a
//!   production stand this read can only answer 404. This is the **inverse** of
//!   every entry above — a read whose record nothing produces — and the list had no
//!   shape for it.
//! * **`pricing_operator_flag` is a migrated table with no code at all**: no
//!   repository, no reader, no writer, and `operator_flag::` appears outside its
//!   entity and its migration registration nowhere. Not a REST defect; recorded
//!   here because a CRUD census is the pass that finds it and this is the document
//!   that claims to say which halves are owed.
//! * **Six of `pricing_policy_object`'s eight configurables have no route in either
//!   direction.** Two are served (`tax-display-policy`, `rounding-policy`); the six
//!   that are not are `enforced_migration_notice_days`, `max_tier_bands_per_row`,
//!   `max_price_rows_per_plan`, `max_custom_interval_days`,
//!   `max_custom_interval_months` and `additional_required_descriptors`. Four of the
//!   six are limits `config.rs`'s `LimitsConfig` also carries, so the operator-visible
//!   source of truth for a tenant limit is ambiguous between a config file and a
//!   column nothing can read.
//!
//! # Gate before parse, and the one stated exception
//!
//! **A handler asks its PDP question before it parses anything the caller sent**,
//! so a caller outside the scope learns they are denied rather than that their
//! body, header or path segment is malformed. **Two window mutations did not**,
//! and every other mutating handler already did; this paragraph exists because the
//! gear stated the rule **twice in two modules and in opposite
//! directions**, each citing itself as the standard — `bulk_imports.rs` called
//! gate-first *"this directory's stated discipline"*, `taxonomies.rs` named the
//! census property that depends on it, and `windows.rs` argued parse-first as *"the
//! shape `schedule_window` reads its idempotency key in"*. Three prose statements
//! where one was owed, and the two outliers answered 400 where both written rules
//! say 403, so the census's recorded question sequence for those routes was a claim
//! about the well-formed subset of requests only.
//!
//! **Two statements of this shape stand in the tree** — `bulk_imports.rs`'s and
//! `taxonomies.rs`' — and `schedule_window` is not a third: it gates first, because
//! reading the request first answers 400 to a caller with no authority on the window
//! plane. Quoting a withdrawn precedent in the present tense is what makes the
//! exception below read as a house pattern instead of the single argued case it is.
//!
//! Nothing was exploitable — the direction is fail-earlier — and it is stated here
//! rather than left to a fourth module doc because that is what the last three
//! attempts produced.
//!
//! **The population is deliberately not counted here**. This read *"thirty-four
//! of the thirty-seven mutating handlers already did; two window mutations did not"*,
//! whose own arithmetic is 36, and neither figure had a derivation: a handler can
//! serve two routes and
//! `grep -cE "OperationBuilder::(post|put|patch|delete)\(" src/api/rest/*.rs` counts
//! **registrations**, not handlers, so the two are not the same number and the prose
//! never said which it meant. What the exceptions are is the load-bearing half and
//! it is stated exactly; how many handlers hold the rule is a thing the reader can
//! derive and this sentence cannot keep true — the lesson `validation.rs`'s stage
//! census records after being wrong twice about its own.
//!
//! **The one exception is `GET /plans/{planId}/sellability`**, which parses its
//! three market parameters first and says why at the call site: the route is
//! `plan × read` over a *market*, and a caller who omitted `currency` has asked a
//! question that names no subject for a gate to be about. It is an exception
//! because it is argued, not because it is a read.
