//! The bulk import's three surfaces
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §5, §4 `inst-bi-api`, `inst-bi-return`,
//! `inst-bs-abort`; D-118, D-290, D-291, D-292).
//!
//! # The two phases are one request, and that is what `202` is for
//!
//! `POST /bulk-imports` runs Phase 1 and, if it passes, Phase 2 — and answers
//! **202 with the operation ref** rather than the outcome. `inst-bi-return` says
//! so, and the reason survives the current implementation running both inline: a
//! batch is a long act, the run is a durable object with a report, and a caller
//! given a `202` and an id is a caller that does not have to hold the connection
//! open to learn what happened. `GET /bulk-imports/{id}` is where the answer
//! lives, for the first call and for every replay alike.
//!
//! A Phase-1 failure is the exception: `BULK_VALIDATION_FAILED`, and it is a
//! **400** — Foundation §3.3 gives the platform no 422 category, so every
//! architectural 422 reaches the wire as a 400 carrying its code. The refusal
//! carries a sentence and not the per-row report: the run is left
//! `validation_failed` holding it, and the `GET` is where a batch's answer lives
//! for every other outcome too.
//!
//! **A Phase-1 *store* fault lands on the same edge**. It is not a
//! validation refusal and does not answer 400 — the caller learns the storage
//! fault — but the run cannot be left where the fault found it: `validating` is a
//! state nothing can leave except this handler, so a run stranded there holds a
//! **spent** client key with no operator remedy at all. So the run is landed
//! `validation_failed` with the fault in its report before the error propagates,
//! and the replay arm then refuses instead of answering `202` for a run that
//! imported nothing.
//!
//! # The client key is the run's, not the gate's
//!
//! O4's replay here is **not** `idempotent::guarded`'s. That gate stores a
//! response body against a key with a TTL; a bulk run stores its own report on
//! its own row, unique per `(tenant, client_key)` by the table's index, and
//! `inst-bk-idem` replays *that* — "including during/after the lock window",
//! which outlives any dedup TTL. So the replay is a read of
//! `bulk_repo::find_by_client_key`, and a second `POST` under a key that already
//! opened a run answers the run it opened.
//!
//! **What the substitution cost, and what it costs now**. Replacing the
//! gate with the run's row dropped the gate's *payload* guard, and for a while
//! nothing here replaced it: the replay was `find_by_client_key` and nothing else,
//! so an operator who corrected a batch and resubmitted it under the same key was
//! answered `202` over the **first** batch's report, having imported nothing, with
//! no member of `BulkImportView` that could reveal it. The run now carries
//! `request_hash` (`pricing_bulk_operation`) — the same digest, on the same axis, as the
//! gate's own `pricing_idempotency_dedup.request_hash` — and a body that does not
//! match it is refused `IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH` rather than answered. So all
//! three axes the replay can be wrong on are closed: the state (D-295), the kind
//! (D-307) and the payload.
//!
//! # There is no row cap, and the absence is deliberate
//!
//! `rows` is a bare `Vec` and nothing on this path counts it. That is recorded
//! rather than fixed, because the two things a cap would need are both missing:
//!
//! * **No stated number on this axis.** The design set's nearest is §1.2's "500
//!   rows/plan", which D-160 settled as a **soft, advisory** publish-time warning
//!   (`PLAN_SIZE_SOFT_CAP_EXCEEDED`, on `warnings[]`, never blocking) — and it is
//!   per *plan*, while a batch spans plans (`pricing_bulk_operation` has a tenant
//!   and no plan). Refusing a request above it would both contradict the decision
//!   that made it advisory and measure the wrong axis. D-125, the read side's hard
//!   cap of 1,000, is a **pagination** decision about a response and says nothing
//!   about a request.
//! * **The cost is real but bounded by bytes.** Both phases run inline, each row is
//!   its own transaction, and every row takes a row lock — so a large batch does
//!   hold a connection open and rows frozen against interactive editors for as long
//!   as it runs. What bounds it today is the platform's request-body limit on the
//!   extractor this handler reads through: a body past it is refused before any
//!   handler code runs, so no run is opened and the idempotency key is not spent.
//!   `a_body_past_the_platform_limit_is_refused_before_the_handler_runs` pins that,
//!   because a bound named in prose and never measured is how "unbounded" came to
//!   be written here in the first place. It is also the **only** bound: this
//!   gear mounts no timeout layer, so the handler carries no deadline of its own.
//!
//! Moving Phase 2 off the request future is the other shape, and it is a design
//! decision rather than a refactor. The route already answers `202` with the run
//! ref and `GET /bulk-imports/{operationId}` already serves the outcome, so the
//! wire contract would survive it — but the gear has no background seam a route
//! can hand work to. `CancellationToken` reaches `Module::serve` and is spent on
//! the three tickers; there is no per-request task to carry the commit, and
//! moving it would change when a run reaches a terminal state, which
//! `CommitLockGuard`, the recorded idempotent response and the abort route all
//! read.
//!
//! What is owed is a **number**, from the design set, on the row axis — and the
//! operator remedy for a batch that is too big already exists either way: the
//! abort route.
//!
//! # Abort is an edge, not a new state
//!
//! `inst-bs-abort`: `committing → completed_with_conflicts`, uncommitted rows
//! reported `not-attempted`, the lock cleared. §4 already has that edge, which is
//! why abort needs no state of its own — and why a crashed import cannot freeze
//! interactive authoring: the operator has a door.

/// spelling of its own, because a second derivation of the same pair is the
/// hazard the interactive plane's version already records: the store has one home
/// for the columns, so a disagreement between two derivations would survive
/// exactly as far as the first metered import.
/// # Every row answers, and every row's faults are named against it

/// `?`, because a row's key and its content fail separately and an operator
/// fixing one at a time is doing the work the batch exists to save them: a bad
/// currency is `scope_key_of`'s, a negative amount is `content_of`'s, and chained
/// through `?` a batch carrying both in one row hears about whichever comes
/// first. The usage
/// line is the one derivation that genuinely depends on the other two, so it is
