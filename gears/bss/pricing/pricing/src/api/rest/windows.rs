//! Slice 7's window surface: the two reads and the three mutations §5 declares.
//!
//! - `GET /plans/{planId}/coverage` — the coverage/gap report an operator
//!   remediates from (`dod-window-coverage`).
//! - `GET /plans/{planId}/sellability` — the gate's surface, four of six
//!   predicates over one pinned delta (`dod-sellability`; see
//!   [`crate::domain::sellability`] for the split and
//!   [`get_plan_sellability`] for which version it answers from).
//! - `POST /prices/{priceId}/windows`, `PATCH`/`DELETE /price-windows/{windowId}` —
//!   each a publish unit (D-99): validation → pending `CatalogVersion` ref →
//!   plan-subject re-projection, answering **202**.
//!   `infra::window::WindowService` is what they call.
//!
//! **The two reads answer different questions about the same plane, and neither is
//! the other's summary.** Coverage is the *truth* side an operator acts on — every
//! key the plan touches, gaps included, over the rows a publish would produce.
//! Sellability is the *pinned* side a storefront reads — the keys a purchase binds
//! on one market, from the frozen version a consumer may pin, which is a different
//! row set at a different instant. A plan can be fully covered on the truth side
//! and unsellable on the pinned one, for the length of one batching delay.
//!
//! # The three mutations answer 202, and none of them answers 200
//!
//! A publish unit is not consumer-visible until `CatalogVersionPublished` + warm. A
//! 200 would tell the caller the coverage changed *for readers*, which it has not:
//! what changed is the truth side, and the read model still answers the previous
//! pin until the projector catches up. The body carries the **pending** handle for
//! the same reason — there is no committed `CatalogVersion` yet and there will not
//! be until the registry batches (D-47).
//!
//! # Two of the three mutations answer 202 **twice**, and D-62 is why
//!
//! The `DELETE` and a **shortening** `PATCH` are on `inst-mat-registered`'s
//! always-material trigger list, so neither commits on one principal. The first call
//! runs every check, opens a pinned approval unit and changes nothing —
//! `outcome = submitted_for_approval`, the stored interval echoed unmoved, no version
//! handle; the call after an independent approve commits — `outcome = mutated`. The
//! `POST` and a lengthening `PATCH` answer `mutated` on the first call, because they
//! are not on the trigger list and what would make *them* material is a threshold
//! policy G6 lands. [`crate::infra::window`]'s module doc carries the split and the
//! obligation.
//!
//! # The state is `GovernanceState`, coverage GET included
//!
//! The mutations need the window service, which holds the catalog-version registry
//! handle, and that handle is the criterion `api::rest::state` splits the two states
//! on. So the whole module moved rather than growing a second `pub fn router`: the
//! route census keys on `pub fn router` under `src/api/rest/**`, and a router named
//! anything else is precisely the hole `every_mounted_router_is_merged_into_both_censuses`
//! exists to close — G3 found a router that was registered, declared, catalogued for
//! authz and answering 404 on every request because the harness never mounted it.
//! One module, one router, one census entry.
//!
//! # `DELETE` takes no idempotency header, and that is §5's call
//!
//! §5's Idempotency column gives the `POST` a **client idempotency key** and the
//! `PATCH` an **`ETag`**, and leaves the `DELETE` cell empty — so this surface asks
//! for neither there, and the omission is the design set's rather than an oversight
//! to improve on. Reported as a divergence rather than fixed by adding a header:
//! a cancel is not naturally idempotent the way a publish is (a revision has one
//! edge out of `draft`; a window has one edge out of `scheduled`, which is
//! `window_repo::transition`'s narrowed `idempotent_arrival` refusing a second
//! cancellation outright — so a retried `DELETE` is answered `WINDOW_NOT_CANCELLABLE`
//! rather than replaying). That refusal is safe and legible, which is why the
//! divergence is reported and not patched.
//!
//! # Why this route exists when `precheck` already reports coverage
//!
//! `POST …/plans/{planId}/publish` runs the aggregate rule set and its refusal
//! already enumerates every uncovered key. This surface answers a different
//! question, and §5 files it under "operator remediation" for that reason:
//!
//! - **It needs no open draft revision.** `infra::publish::assemble` answers
//!   `NotFound` for a plan with nothing to publish, so a published plan whose
//!   coverage an operator wants to inspect — the ordinary case — cannot be
//!   pre-checked at all.
//! - **It reports state, not violations.** Every key, its intervals, its derived
//!   coverage end and its interior gaps, including the keys that are fine. A
//!   refusal names only what is wrong, which is the wrong shape for "what does
//!   this plan's time axis look like".
//!
//! What it deliberately does **not** report is `AVAILABILITY_OUTSIDE_COVERAGE`.
//! That rule judges the plan's `availableFrom`/`availableTo` against per-key
//! coverage, so it is a finding about the *plan* rather than a property of a key,
//! and the publish report is where it belongs. Naming it here as well would give
//! one violation two surfaces to disagree on.
//!
//! **DIVERGENCE (found 2026-08-05, reported not fixed): a cancel can move a published
//! plan's dates outside its own coverage, and the publish report is not always a
//! surface.** `AvailabilityInsideCoverage` is registered in the **publish** pipeline
//! only, and a window mutation runs the two rules `inst-fg-when` names — so cancelling
//! a plan's *first* window, which is legal whenever a later open-ended one keeps the key
//! covered, moves the coverage **start** past `availableFrom` with nothing re-checking.
//! The textual exclusion is defensible (`inst-fg-when` is step 2 of §3's Future-Gap
//! Detection, written about that section's two rules) and running the publish-time set
//! inside a mutation is not available either: `inst-wc-required` would refuse the very
//! mutation that fixes it.
//!
//! The sentence above — *"the publish report is its surface"* — is **not** the whole
//! answer, and D-128 is why: a retired plan can never publish again and a published plan
//! nobody revises gets no report, so for those the finding has no reader at all. What
//! finishes the argument is the **gate**: predicate (1) evaluates each bound key's
//! coverage at the caller's instant, so over the uncovered interval the plan-market is
//! `not_sellable` whatever its dates say. So the residue is an operator-visible
//! incoherence and not a sales hazard — nothing can be sold into the hole.
//! `sqlite_window_service.rs::a_cancel_can_move_a_published_plan_outside_its_own_coverage`
//! executes both halves.
//!
//! # The row set is the publish check's own
//!
//! [`CANDIDATE_ROW_STATES`] — the plan's `published` rows plus the `draft` rows a
//! publish would produce. Taking the published plane alone would make this
//! surface answer a different question from the one whose failure sent the
//! operator here, and the whole value of a remediation surface is that acting on
//! it makes the publish pass.

             `CatalogVersionPublished` + warm, so a `200` would claim the coverage changed for \
             readers when it has not. `effectiveFrom` must be strictly in the future \
             (`WINDOW_START_IN_PAST`), the interval must not intersect a scheduled or active \
             sibling on the same key (`WINDOW_OVERLAP`, 409 - siblings include every price row of \
             the plan on that key, not just this one), and the resulting interval set must open no \

             first answer verbatim and mints no second window, and the same key with a different \
             body is `IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH` (409). What a key identifies is an **attempt**, \
             not an act - so retrying a request you never got an answer to is safe, and \
             **completing an act a reviewer has since approved is a new attempt and needs a new \
             key**. Re-issuing the refused request under its original key replays the refusal, \

             entry for the row's currency it commits on the first call (`outcome = mutated`), and \
             with none `inst-mat-failsafe` answers and it opens a unit like a shorten. The \

             committed act answers with the `ETag` its successor must assert, so the tag a caller \

             deletion**: the store refuses `DELETE` on the row unconditionally, because a \
             cancelled schedule is a fact an auditor is entitled to see - which is also why a \
             second cancellation of one window is refused `WINDOW_NOT_CANCELLABLE` (409) rather \
             than answered `Ok`. Any state but `scheduled` gets that same refusal, and an active \
             window is shortened through its `effectiveTo` instead, which is the operation the \
             state machine leaves. A cancel that would leave the key uncovered with no successor is \
             `WINDOW_TRAILING_VOID`, fail-closed with no exemption (D-182). It takes **no** \
             `Idempotency-Key` and **no** `If-Match`: S5's idempotency column for this surface is \

             `outcome = submitted_for_approval` while the window **stays `scheduled`** - this is \
             the act D-62 exists to stop one operator performing alone, a cancelled successor \
             silently reverting an approved price change. The flip happens on the call made after \
