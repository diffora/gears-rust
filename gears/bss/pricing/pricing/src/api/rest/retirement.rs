//! `POST /bss-pricing/v1/plans/{planId}/retire` — the plan's end
//! (`inst-rt-api`, `inst-rt-return`, `inst-re-warn`, D-109, D-128).
//!
//! `api::rest::cutovers`' shape, and every argument that module makes about this
//! layer holds here verbatim and is not restated: why the body is parsed **after**
//! the gate, why the answer is `202`, and why the verdict rides the response for
//! the record rather than as an explanation.
//!
//! # What differs, and it is the whole of this module's own content
//!
//! **One route, two acts, discriminated by the body.** `inst-rt-api` puts the
//! dry-run *first* — "returns the cancelled-window preview" — and the confirm
//! behind it. They are one path rather than two because they must answer from the
//! same judgement: a preview computed by a different endpoint from the commit is
//! a preview an operator can read and then watch do something else.
//! `infra::retirement` enforces that by sharing `compose_preview`; this module's
//! part is not to offer a second way in.
//!
//! **The gate is `plan × retire`, an action of its own.** Not `write`, which the
//! cutover takes: retirement is a publish unit with no way back (D-128), so an
//! operator holding the authority to *change* a plan does not thereby hold the
//! authority to *end* it. The action already exists in the catalog
//! (`authz::actions::RETIRE`) and this is its first route.
//!
//! **Both arms of the confirm answer `202`, and neither can honestly answer
//! `200`.** A retirement is always material (D-109), so the ordinary arm is
//! `submitted_for_approval`; the committed arm still leaves a **pending**
//! `CatalogVersion` behind, so the fact the caller most cares about — that the
//! plan reads not-sellable from a pin — is not true yet either.
//!
//! **The dry-run answers `200`.** It is a read: it opens no unit, requests no
//! version and writes nothing, which is what makes it legible to the approver
//! *before* the decision (D-61's reviewability invariant).

             **current** revision, which stays current - so the projector keeps sourcing it and an \
             in-flight subscriber's arrears charge still resolves. Retirement stops **selling**, \
             never **rating**. \
             \
             `dryRun` (**default `true`**) returns the preview an operator confirms against: every \
             not-yet-active window with what would happen to it, kept windows labelled distinctly \
             from cancelled ones, and the references that would block the act. A window is \
             cancelled only on a scope key with **no** in-flight subscribers (D-51); a window that \
             is a key's continuing coverage is kept, because cancelling it opens a trailing void no \
             gap check can see. The presence question is asked of the D-79 lane in **one** call \
             (D-131); while that lane has no client, the fail-closed posture reads every key as \
             occupied and every window is kept (D-182), which `presenceUnresolved` reports. \
             \
             **A retirement is always material** (D-109), so no configured threshold makes it \
             commit on one principal: the confirm answers `submitted_for_approval` until an \
             independent reviewer decides, then `retired`. Both answer `202` - the committed arm \
             leaves a **pending** `CatalogVersion`, so the plan does not read not-sellable from a \
             pin until that version completes. \
             \
             Refused with `RETIRE_PLAN_REFERENCED` (409) while a bundle composes the plan or an \
             add-on overrides one of its price rows; the refusal enumerates the referrers, because \
             the remedy is to re-compose or retire a *named* one first. A plan that is not at a \
             published revision is refused with its own state. \
             \
             Gates on `plan` x `retire` - an action of its own, because holding the authority to \
