//! The grandfathering surface's two mutating doors: `POST
//! /bss-pricing/v1/plans/{planId}/cutovers`, which **creates** a retained
//! generation (`inst-gc-api`, `inst-gc-return`, D-100), and `PATCH
//! /bss-pricing/v1/prices/{priceId}/grandfather-until`, which moves the bound that
//! generation expires on (`inst-gs-bound`, `inst-gs-tighten`).
//!
//! Two routes in one module because they are one mechanism read from its two ends,
//! and S7 §5 and S5's endpoint map both list them that way. The horizon door's own
//! argument — what it refuses, why it asks D-04's span against the horizon it is
//! *proposing*, why it records a before-image and why it enqueues no event — is in
//! [`crate::infra::grandfather`], not here; this layer carries only the two PDP
//! questions the path shape forces and the wire shapes.
//!
//! `api::rest::supersessions`' shape, deliberately, because the two acts differ in
//! three things and a reader should find those and nothing else. Every argument
//! that module makes about *this* layer holds here verbatim and is not restated:
//! why the body names a **row id** rather than the ten scope-key axes, why the
//! authz pair is `plan × write` and not `plan × publish`, why the body is parsed
//! **after** the gate, why both arms answer `202` with a token saying which, and
//! why the minted ids may be discarded.
//!
//! # What differs, and it is the whole of this module's own content
//!
//! **The answer carries a second row and a second window.** A supersession moves
//! one row onto a key; a cutover moves one on and **retains** another on a new
//! generation, so `copyPriceId` and `copyKey` are on the response and are not
//! nullable on the controlled arm — both drafts are staged there, because
//! `inst-gc-compose` clause (a) makes them the reviewer's subject.
//!
//! **There is no materiality question to report.** `inst-mat-registered` registers
//! a grandfathering cutover, so the act is material whatever a threshold policy
//! says and whatever delta it carries. The response therefore carries the verdict
//! for the record rather than as an explanation of *why* an approval was needed,
//! and no configured threshold can make this route commit on one principal.
//!
//! **The idempotency key is `(planId, key-set hash, cutover instant)`** (D-28), not
//! `(planId, scope key, instant)`. A retry naming a different selection is a
//! different act — see `infra::cutover::cutover_unit_ref` for why that protects the
//! caller rather than endangering them.

             generation - S7 section 4's `active_indefinite -> active_bounded` (`inst-gs-bound`) and \
             `active_bounded -> active_bounded` (`inst-gs-tighten`) edges, and the only door in \
             this gear that moves the column on a published row. Answers `202` on both arms, \
             `outcome` saying which: `submitted_for_approval` while a second principal has not \
             decided the unit, `tightened` when it committed. \
             \
             **Always material** (`inst-mat-registered`), so no configured threshold makes it \
             commit on one principal; the approval unit's subject names the transition - the \
             plan, the row, the prior horizon and the new one - so an approval taken for one \
             instant cannot authorize another, and a unit approved while the horizon read `T` \
             cannot complete after somebody else has moved it. \
             \
             The horizon only ever moves **earlier**: a later instant re-grants an eligibility a \
             second principal already approved the end of, and an equal one is a transition that \
             moves nothing (`GRANDFATHER_LOOSEN_FORBIDDEN`). Clearing it is not expressible - \
             the machine has no edge back to indefinite. Only an `existing_grandfathered` row \
             carries a horizon at all (`GRANDFATHER_UNTIL_FORBIDDEN`, D-147), and a draft row's \
             is authored through `PATCH /bss-pricing/v1/plans/{planId}/prices/{priceId}` with \
             the rest of its content (`LIFECYCLE_FORBIDDEN`). \
             \
             The act is checked against **D-04's coverage bound** as it would leave it: this \
             generation's windows must run unbroken from `max(cohort, now)` through the new \
             horizon plus the longest billing cycle sold on the key, so that every bound period \
             stays rateable until its renewal re-bind (`WINDOW_TRAILING_VOID`). Tightening a \
             bound that already exists can never break that; setting the **first** bound on a \
             market whose plan authors no recurring frequency can, and is refused. \
             \
             `If-Match` is mandatory and carries the row's own version. That version is **frozen** \
             with a published row's content (D-141), so it is the same tag before and after: what \
             actually serialises two tighteners is the horizon itself, which rides the update's \
             own predicate and answers the loser `409 CONCURRENT_MUTATION`. \
             \
             Nothing is written on the controlled arm - no column, no pending version reference, \
             no audit record beyond the unit itself. Gates on `plan` x `write`.",

            "Composes the **grandfathering cutover** (D-100) over one canonical scope key: a \
             successor draft on the key's own axes, a **grandfathered copy** of the row being \
             closed on a new generation of that key, the current window's `effectiveTo` shortened \
             to the cutover instant, and both new windows scheduled open-ended from it - one \
             approval unit and one local ACID transaction, or nothing. Answers `202` on both \
             arms, `outcome` saying which: `submitted_for_approval` while a second principal has \
             not decided the unit, `cut_over` when it committed. \
             \
             **A cutover is always material** (`inst-mat-registered`), so no configured threshold \
             makes it commit on one principal; the verdict in the answer is the record of that \
             rather than an explanation. \
             \
             The body names the **current `priceId`** rather than the ten scope-key axes, and the \
             `{planId}` segment is checked against the row's own plan - a row of another plan \
             answers `404`. The copy's content is **not** a member of the body: it is the \
             predecessor's, carried onto the new generation, because that is what retained \
             subscribers keep paying. The instant must be strictly future at submit and at least \
             D-47's max batching delay ahead at the commit (`CUTOVER_INSTANT_PASSED`); the key \
             must hold coverage at it, a dormant key being a revival rather than a cutover \
             (`CUTOVER_GAP`); and an instant some generation of the key already carries is \
             refused (`DUPLICATE_SCOPE_KEY`), since every cutover mints its own generation. \
             \
             **No `Idempotency-Key` header**: the act is keyed by `(planId, key-set hash, cutover \
             instant)` (D-28), so a second identical request is answered with the *same* pending \
             unit, while a request naming a different selection is a different act. \
             \
