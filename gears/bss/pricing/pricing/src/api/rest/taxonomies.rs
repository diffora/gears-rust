//! `GET/PUT /bss-pricing/v1/config/taxonomies/{region|brand|partner|org_tier}` —
//! the tenant's four scope-value universes (`design/04-currency-tax.md` §5, §6,
//! `inst-tx-mutation`).
//!
//! # This is the surface the gear has been missing, not a convenience
//!
//! Slice 9's `inst-plv-scope` validates every non-`global` overlay scope value
//! against one of these four tables, and Slice 4's `inst-tx-region` validates
//! every price row's region against one of them. **Both rules shipped before any
//! of the four had a writer.** The consequence was not a cosmetic gap: an
//! operator could not author a brand-scoped `PriceOverlay` end to end, because
//! the value the overlay must name had nowhere to come from, and the only way to
//! declare one was direct SQL. That is the D-211 shape — a rule whose universe is
//! unreachable — arriving from the authoring side instead of the validating one.
//!
//! # One route pair for four classes, and why the class is a path segment
//!
//! §5 writes the row as a single cell, `{region|brand|partner|org_tier}`, and the
//! four are the same resource shape over four universes: same columns, same state
//! machine, same guard, same gate. A route each would be four copies of one
//! handler differing in a `match` arm, and the day a fifth class is declared
//! (`customerGroup` is already named in Slice 9 §3, waiting on the membership
//! half) it would be a fifth copy rather than a fifth enum member.
//!
//! The class is a **path segment** and not a query parameter because it selects
//! the resource rather than filtering it: `/config/taxonomies/brand` is a
//! different document from `/config/taxonomies/partner`, with its own `ETag` and
//! its own concurrent editors. A query parameter would make them one resource
//! with four representations, and one tag would then have to cover all four.
//!
//! **The segment is the token the overlay plane stores** — `TaxonomyClass::
//! path_segment` returns `ScopeClass::as_str`, so the two cannot diverge rather
//! than merely happening not to. §5 spelled the last class `orgTier` and this
//! route answered to that, on the argument that §5 is the normative statement of
//! the route and a path segment is not a JSON field. **D-241 closed it the other
//! way**: an operator meets both spellings in one sitting, and a client generated
//! from the `OpenAPI` document carries two names for one class. `orgTier` is
//! refused rather than aliased, because two spellings that both route is the
//! state in which neither is canonical.
//!
//! # The `PUT` carries the whole taxonomy
//!
//! `taxonomy_repo`'s module doc carries the argument in full. In short: the
//! resource is the tenant's value set, so the body is that set and not a patch,
//! and a value the body omits is **retired** — never deleted, because a value a
//! published row names has to keep existing. A retirement the guard refuses fails
//! the whole `PUT` with `TAXONOMY_VALUE_IN_USE` (409) and writes nothing.
//!
//! # `If-Match` is required, and the bootstrap is not an exception
//!
//! §5's Idempotency cell for this row is `ETag`, and D-171 makes the header
//! required wherever a table names a precondition. The reasoning
//! `api::rest::threshold_policy` records applies here unchanged, including the
//! premise it had to withdraw: a tenant with no taxonomy at all is answered
//! **200** with an empty list, so the resource always has a representation and
//! therefore always has a tag. A first `PUT` reads it off the `GET` like any
//! other.
//!
//! It matters more here than the row count suggests, because the `PUT` is a
//! whole-set replacement. Without a precondition, two admins who each read the
//! brand list and each add one value would produce a taxonomy holding **one** of
//! the two additions and silently retiring the other's — a lost update that looks
//! exactly like a value somebody meant to withdraw.
//!
//! # The gate is `config`, and it is one gate for both verbs' subjects
//!
//! `cf.bss.pricing.config.v1~` already exists and its own doc names this surface:
//! *"the tenant config plane (`write`, `read`): tax-display policy and the
//! taxonomies"*. **No authz vocabulary is minted here.** Deliberately not
//! `approval_policy`, which is segregated so a config admin cannot weaken the
//! thresholds governing their own changes — a taxonomy is the config plane's own
//! subject, and §10 assigns it to `CatalogAdmin`.
