//! The price authoring plane: `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` and the paginated list
//! (`design/03-price-structure.md` §5, D-125, D-140, D-141, D-148).
//!
//! # This surface validates a row's shape only where the frozen key already
//! # decides it, and a reader would otherwise assume either extreme
//!
//! `MODEL_KIND_MISSING`, the tier-band geometry family, `AMOUNT_PLACEMENT_INVALID`,
//! `LEVEL_*` and most of Slice 3's rules are **publish-time** and do not run here.
//! Authoring a shape-invalid draft stays legal: §4.2 puts the whole rule set at the
//! publish pre-check, an author assembles a row over several calls, and refusing an
//! intermediate state at save time would contradict that design outright.
//!
//! **D-312 carves out one narrow subset, and it is a subset of violations rather
//! than of rules.** `POST` and `PATCH` run the same row rule set and keep only what
//! is marked [`Stage::Write`](crate::domain::validation::Stage): a fault whose every
//! operand is present in the request with one of them frozen by the canonical scope
//! key — `chargeKind` above all, the key being uneditable after create. Such a
//! request is complete, self-inconsistent and knowably unpublishable the instant it
//! arrives, and the only call that resolves it *retracts the field just sent* rather
//! than adding anything, so refusing it here costs an author nothing they could
//! legitimately have wanted. `EVAL_POLICY_MISPLACED` therefore appears on **both**
//! sides of this line: `billingGranularity` on a recurring key is refused here,
//! while tier bands on a `flat` row are content against content that
//! `model_kind: graduated` resolves, and they wait for publish. The refusal is the
//! same enumerated `ValidationFailed` envelope publish uses, not a single message,
//! and the publish pre-check still runs the whole set, this subset included.
//!
//! What this plane refuses **besides** that is what the store itself decides — a duplicate
//! canonical scope key (`DUPLICATE_SCOPE_KEY`, on the draft plane too since
//! D-148), a stale entity tag (`STALE_VERSION`), a horizon off its eligibility
//! class (`GRANDFATHER_UNTIL_FORBIDDEN`), an instant finer than the millisecond
//! quantum (`TIMESTAMP_PRECISION_EXCEEDED`), a value past its column
//! (`InvalidArgument`), and an edit of a frozen row (`LIFECYCLE_FORBIDDEN`) —
//! plus the two idempotency refusals the create's gate can raise. Every one of
//! those already exists; nothing here is minted. The two Slice-10 primitives
//! this surface refuses (below) mint nothing either — an unsupported field is a
//! malformed request under the Foundation validation envelope.
//!
//! # The `{planId}` segment is checked, not decorative
//!
//! `PATCH` and `DELETE` name a plan **and** a price, while the repository keys
//! on `price_id` alone. So both verbs verify the row actually belongs to the
//! named plan and answer 404 otherwise. A path that names a parent it does not
//! check is a path that lets a caller mutate a row through the wrong plan's URL
//! — and it makes the authz `resource_id` argument a fiction, since the gate is
//! asked about a resource the handler then does not confirm.
//!
//! # What Slice 10 has not landed is refused here, not validated
//!
//! `tierQualificationWindow` (D-40, D-60) and the **`carry`** half of
//! `includedAllowance` (D-45, D-130) are members of [`PriceContentView`] and are
//! refused with [`DomainError::InvalidRequest`] the moment a request carries
//! one.
//!
//! **The allowance's `none` half is no longer among them.** D-177 clause (3)
//! made this refusal removable only in the change that lands the rules *and* the
//! compile, and that is the change: `inst-ac-gate`'s six refusals are registered
//! row-local rules ([`crate::domain::rules::allowance`]) that this very write
//! runs, and `inst-ac-band` / `inst-ac-marker` are
//! [`crate::domain::allowance`], materialized into the read model by the
//! projector. A `{N, none}` declaration is therefore judged when it arrives and
//! honoured when it publishes, which is the whole of what the refusal was
//! holding the line for.
//!
//! What is still refused, and why it is a store rather than a rule:
//!
//! - **`tierQualificationWindow`, at any value** — none of `inst-tt-forbidden` /
//!   `inst-tt-window-pair` / `inst-tt-zero-band` / `inst-tt-fixture` exists, nor
//!   does the rate lock (`inst-tt-lock`). Storing a value this gear can neither
//!   judge nor honour is precisely the state `inst-tt-forbidden` names when it
//!   says *an accepted-but-ignored value would mask authoring errors*.
//! - **`includedAllowance` with `rolloverPolicy = carry`** — `inst-ac-carry`
//!   materializes a `promotional` grant into `pricing_plan_grant` (D-52), a
//!   table this gear does not have, so the carried allowance would freeze into
//!   an immutable version and never be issued.
//!
//! The projector and the evaluation-policy roster carry both fields, so a stored
//! value that reached publish would freeze. *(This sentence said "the day Slice 5
//! mounts the publish route". It is mounted, and the freeze did not follow,
//! because `publish::rules::NoUnjudgedPrimitive` refuses what is still unbuilt
//! inside the publish set — see D-298. The guard on this surface still earns its
//! place, because a row stored here that publish then refuses is a row nobody can
//! publish.)*
//!
//! Building the refusals **without** the compile would have been worse, not
//! better: a `graduated` row carrying `{100, none}` would have passed all six
//! `inst-ac-gate` rules, published, and then been billed from unit one — an
//! allowance accepted, *validated*, and silently ignored. That is the shape
//! D-149 clause (3), D-161 clause (1), D-167 clause (3) and D-168 clause (1)
//! each refuse one artifact over, and it is why the six and the compile landed
//! in one change.
//!
//! The members **stay** on the view. D-174 clause (1) puts a member the gear
//! does not model outside the idempotency digest and therefore inside the replay
//! set, so deleting them would convert an accepted field into a *silently
//! ignored* one. The response half stays too: the domain model, the storage
//! round trip and the D-129 supersession guard all read both fields, and a read
//! that dropped them would lose a field that guard compares. No code is minted
//! — a field whose slice has not landed is a malformed request under the
//! Foundation validation envelope, the class D-141 and D-171 give an absent
//! `If-Match`.

             required: the gate runs in the same transaction as the insert, so a retry carrying \
             the same key and body is answered the recorded response - the original price id \
