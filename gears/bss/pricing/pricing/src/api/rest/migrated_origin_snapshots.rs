//! `GET /bss-pricing/v1/migrated-origin-snapshots/{subscriptionRef}` — the
//! `migrated-origin` read surface (D-102, `inst-sy-surface`, `inst-sy-payload`,
//! `inst-sy-firstrating`).
//!
//! # Why this endpoint has to exist at all
//!
//! A `migrated-origin` ref resolves through **no** `CatalogVersion` by
//! construction (D-87, Foundation §4.4), so the read-model contract cannot
//! deliver it — the read model is keyed by version. Until D-102 the payload had
//! no reader-facing surface of any kind: it sat in `pricing_snapshot_provenance`,
//! S5's endpoint map covering "every REST surface of Slices 2–12" had none of it,
//! and none of the five §9.2 contracts carried it, while the PRD required
//! *"Rating/Tariffs evaluate **from that payload**"*. The rule existed and the
//! consumption mechanism did not.
//!
//! # The authz object is `plan` and the path object is a subscription
//!
//! Deliberately, and it is the one read surface in this gear where the two
//! differ. The gate is `plan × read` — the same authority the read model is
//! served under, because this *is* catalog content, just content no version
//! addresses. It is called by the Rating/Tariffs **service identity**.
//!
//! Because the two differ, **tenant binding is stated rather than inherited**:
//! the `subscriptionRef` resolves only within the caller's own `tenant_id`
//! through the Foundation §2.2 `SecureORM` filter. On every other read the path
//! object is itself the thing the scope filters, so row ownership comes for free;
//! here it does not, and D-102's own review fix (N-3) says so.
//!
//! # 404 before synthesis, and it is a contract rather than an accident
//!
//! `inst-sy-firstrating`: rating a legacy subscription **before** synthesis fails
//! closed into the exception path, synthesis runs as a separate audited step, and
//! rating retries against the frozen result. So a 404 here is the signal that
//! drives that flow — never a partial payload, never a guessed one. A caller that
//! got `200` with an incomplete body could not tell "not synthesized yet" from
//! "synthesized and this is what it costs".

             it, resolving no id through the read model. \

             this surface can emit. The field is kept rather than dropped: it is provenance on a \
             record with a seven-year horizon, and an auditor reconstructing a disputed legacy \
             charge still reads which rule resolved the row without re-running the lookup. \
