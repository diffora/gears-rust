//! The bundle authoring surface — `design/08-bundles.md` §5,
//! `inst-ba-author` / `inst-ba-validate` / `inst-ba-return`.
//!
//! Three routes: create the bundle on its plan, replace an open draft revision's
//! whole composition, and publish it.
//!
//! # D-11 is why the third route's gate is not the first two's
//!
//! Authoring is `bundle × write` (`ProductManager`, `CatalogAdmin`). **Publish
//! requires `plan × publish` only** — D-11, decided 2026-07-10: under the
//! conjunction the design set originally stated, only `CatalogAdmin` could publish
//! a bundle while §1.3 promises `FinanceManager` can, and one of the three
//! statements had to be wrong. Publish is a plan-level act; the authoring
//! authority was already exercised, and the composition is protected at publish
//! time by the approval content pin. Component checks are **validations, not
//! caller authz**, which is why nothing here gates on the components' own plans.
//!
//! # The composition is addressed by the bundle and versioned by the revision
//!
//! `If-Match` on the composition route carries the **plan revision's** entity tag
//! (`"<revision>-<version>"`, D-170), not a tag of the composition's own. The
//! composition has none, deliberately: a component-set edit advances the
//! revision's tag, so two authors editing one draft cannot both satisfy their
//! precondition. `BundleRepo`'s module doc carries the argument.
//!
//! **§5 spells the composition route `PATCH /bss-pricing/v1/bundles`** — a
//! collection PATCH with the subject in the body. This mounts
//! `PATCH /bss-pricing/v1/bundles/{bundleId}` instead, because a precondition
//! addresses a resource and a collection that answers `If-Match` is a collection
//! pretending to be one. The divergence is reported in the owed register (B-10)
//! rather than smoothed over.
//!
//! # 422 does not exist on this platform
//!
//! §5 types every composition refusal 422 and that notation is architectural:
//! `CanonicalError` renders `InvalidArgument`, `FailedPrecondition` and
//! `OutOfRange` all as **400**. The **code string** is the discriminator a
//! consumer matches on, and the ten of them travel inside the `ValidationFailed`
//! envelope, one violation per failing rule — which is what makes a composition
//! remediable in one pass. No route here declares a 422 response.
