//! `GET/PUT /bss-pricing/v1/customer-groups/taxonomy` — the BSS customer-group
//! value universe, on its **own** route (`design/09-price-overlays.md` §3
//! `inst-cg-taxonomy`, §5; `design/05-governance.md`'s endpoint map).
//!
//! # Why this is not a fifth arm of `api::rest::taxonomies`
//!
//! `api::rest::taxonomies` mounts `GET/PUT /config/taxonomies/{class}` over
//! `TaxonomyClass`'s four members and gates on `config × read/write`. A first
//! attempt at this surface was briefed as a fifth arm of that enum on that same
//! route, and it was the wrong shape: `design/09-price-overlays.md` §5 gives the
//! customer-group taxonomy its **own** route, and `05-governance.md`'s
//! endpoint-mapping table says so explicitly — *"the customer-group taxonomy is
//! **not** here: it lives at `/bss-pricing/v1/customer-groups/taxonomy` under
//! `customer_group` (more sensitive)"*. `authz.rs`'s own module doc gives the
//! reason: *"`customer_group` is its own resource, not part of `plan` —
//! per-payer membership is payer-level commercial data, more sensitive than
//! plan authoring"* — and the taxonomy of legal values for that data is the same
//! sensitivity class as the membership records it will gate. Filing it under
//! `config × write` would have handed every `CatalogAdmin` who declares a brand
//! or a region the same authority over the customer-group vocabulary, which is
//! exactly the widening `05-governance.md` segregates against.
//!
//! `TaxonomyClass` (`crate::domain::taxonomy`) therefore gains **no** arm for
//! this class — that enum is the shared `{class}` route's own vocabulary, and an
//! arm there is precisely what would make this value set addressable through
//! the route it must not use. The two authz permissions this route consumes,
//! `customer_group × read` and `customer_group × write`, are already declared
//! in `gts/permissions.rs` (review finding Z13-13) and this route is their
//! **first** consumer — no new authz vocabulary is minted here.
//!
//! # The shape otherwise
//!
//! Same resource discipline as `api::rest::taxonomies`, restated because the
//! two are siblings rather than the same handler: the `PUT` carries the
//! **whole** value set (a value the body omits is retired, never deleted,
//! because a value a published overlay scope still names has to keep
//! existing), `If-Match` is required (D-171; a tenant with no values at all is
//! answered `200` with an empty list and a tag, so the bootstrap reads its
//! precondition off the `GET` like every other caller), and a retirement the
//! `inst-cg-taxonomy` guard refuses fails the whole `PUT` with
//! `TAXONOMY_VALUE_IN_USE` (409), writing nothing.
//!
//! This taxonomy carries no `tax_*` markers — those are D-01's, declared on the
//! region taxonomy alone — so its value view is narrower than
//! `TaxonomyValueView`'s.
