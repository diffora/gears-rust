//! The preconditions every mutating route on this surface speaks: the `ETag` it
//! hands back, the `If-Match` it demands, the `Idempotency-Key` two of them
//! demand, and the digest that decides whether two requests carrying one key are
//! the same request.
//!
//! It is one module rather than seven copies because each of these is a
//! **contract**, not a parse. D-141 says every mutating verb on a draft row
//! presents its `ETag`; D-145 says the abandon carries one for the same reason;
//! §5's idempotency column says two creates carry a client key. A route that
//! spelled any of those for itself would be free to spell it differently, and
//! the way that failure presents is a caller whose precondition is accepted on
//! one verb and refused on another.
//!
//! # What this module refuses, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! **This module refuses a request it cannot understand. The store refuses one
//! whose premise has moved.** A well-formed tag that does not match the row is
//! none of this module's business: the repository's compare-and-swap is the
//! authority on that, and it answers [`RepoError::StaleRowVersion`] →
//! `STALE_VERSION` (409) naming both versions. Comparing here as well would put
//! a second, weaker guard in front of the real one — one that reads the row,
//! decides, and then hands the decision to a statement that races it.
//!
//! [`RepoError::StaleRowVersion`]: crate::infra::storage::RepoError::StaleRowVersion
//!
//! # No new wire code
//!
//! Every refusal here is [`DomainError::InvalidRequest`] → 400. That is not a
//! shortcut: `03-price-structure.md` §5 (D-141) settles it in as many words —
//! "an absent precondition is a malformed request under the Foundation
//! validation envelope, so **no new code** is minted". The same reading covers
//! an unparseable tag, a wildcard, a key of the wrong shape and an undecodable
//! cursor, because a caller cannot act differently on any of them than on the
//! others: the request as sent cannot be interpreted, and the remedy is to send
//! a different one.
//!
//! # The entity tag is the domain's, not the transport's
//!
//! [`RowVersion::to_etag`] and [`RowVersion::from_etag`] live in
//! `domain::concurrency` and are called from here rather than re-implemented,
//! for the reason that module's own doc gives: the repositories and the REST
//! layer have to agree, to the byte, on what tag denotes what version, and a
//! second rendering is free to drift from the one that parses tags back. What
//! this module adds is the **header** layer the domain must not know about —
//! which header carries the tag, and what an absent one means.
//!
//! [`PolicyTag`] arrived under the same rule and is worth naming because it is the
//! one tag on this surface that is **not** a row version: the
//! approval-threshold policy has no mutable row, so its tag is a digest over the
//! two facts its `GET` serves (D-186). The rendering is still the domain's, and
//! [`policy_etag`]/[`if_match_policy`] are still only the header layer.
