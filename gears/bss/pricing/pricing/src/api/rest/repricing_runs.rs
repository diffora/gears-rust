//! The mass-repricing run's two surfaces
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §5, §3 `inst-mr-api`, `inst-mr-journal`,
//! `inst-mr-return`, `inst-mp-journal`, `inst-mp-grandfathered`; D-88, D-134,
//! D-261, D-293, D-307).
//!
//! # What a run built here does, and — as plainly as possible — what it does not
//!
//! `POST /repricing-runs` validates the changeover instant, expands the selector
//! over the tenant's **published** rows, refuses `RUN_SELECTOR_EMPTY` if that
//! expansion is empty, opens a [`BulkKind::Repricing`] run, freezes the row set
//! into `pricing_repricing_journal`, evaluates the run's materiality **once**
//! over every plan it touches (`inst-mr-coalesce`), and writes the edge the
//! verdict names: `validating -> awaiting_approval` under an opened approval
//! unit when material, `validating -> committing` otherwise.
//!
//! **And then it hands the apply to a lane and answers.** On the non-material path
//! `open_run` has already taken the run to `committing`; this handler enqueues that
//! run's apply on [`crate::infra::repricing::RunApplyLane`] and answers `202` with
//! the run standing there, so the `202` means *accepted and being applied* rather
//! than *applied*. `POST /repricing-runs/{runId}/abort` is what makes handing back
//! `committing` safe: it ends a run whose apply never ran. A **material** run is
//! left where `open_run` put it and its apply belongs to `api::rest::approvals`,
//! enqueued on the same lane when a second principal approves the batch unit.
//!
//! **The apply is therefore not synchronous with any request, and
//! `GET /repricing-runs/{runId}` is where its outcome is read** (`inst-mr-return`
//! makes that read the progress endpoint for exactly this reason). A `pending`
//! journal row in that read still means the row was not attempted rather than
//! attempted and unchanged (D-261) — what changed is that an operator may see the
//! whole journal `pending` for a moment after a `202`, which is a run the applier
//! has not reached yet and not a run that stalled.
//!
//! **A module's own doc is a claim; the call sites are the measurement.** "What it
//! still does not do is apply a price… a `committing` run advances no further than
//! that state, with every journal row still `pending`" was false of this file while
//! an `apply_run_in` call sat in it — and it was read at face value and repeated
//! into the operator-facing UI, which then told an author that opening a run moves
//! no price.
//!
//! The debts that do remain are named rather than left to be discovered:
//!
//! * **The redrive.** The surface is a create, a read and an abort
//!   ([`REPRICING_RUN_ABORT`], `infra::repricing::abandon_committing_run`), so a
//!   run stalled `committing` has a door out — it *ends*, with its unreached rows
//!   marked `failed`. What is still owed is the door that would drive such a run
//!   *forward* instead: `apply_run_in` is written to be re-entered and
//!   `bulk_repo::take_locks` is idempotent for its own run, so the capability is a
//!   route away, and it needs no check of its own for `inst-co-single-pending`:
//!   `infra::repricing::refuse_targets_on_a_held_key` re-asks it on every arrival
//!   to the apply, which is what the lane made necessary and what a redrive would
//!   be one more of.
//! * **The apply's own limits** (`inst-mr-apply`, `inst-mr-validate-scope`) —
//!   successor rows, their outbox records, the journal's `pending -> applied`
//!   flips in one commit per plan, the re-run of the row-local and
//!   plan-aggregate rule sets, and the bulk lock over the run's
//!   own rows — live in [`crate::infra::repricing::apply_run_in`]; see that
//!   module's own doc for what the lock does and, as plainly, does not close.
//!   **Materiality does not wait on any of that.** The
//!   `ChangeSet` [`run_materiality`] evaluates carries each selected row with
//!   the run's own adjustment already applied to it ([`project_row`]) — real
//!   arithmetic over the row's published amount, not the apply's durable
//!   successor and not a zero-delta stand-in — compared against the same rows
//!   as currently published. The per-currency comparison
//!   (`inst-mat-percurrency`, `inst-mr-coalesce`'s "any row over its
//!   own-currency threshold trips the run") is therefore real: a run's own
//!   adjustment size decides materiality together with the configured policy,
//!   not the fail-safe alone.
//! * **`project_row`'s one open corner**, named rather than papered over, and
//!   **restated**: it is a property of a **rate-priced** row, not of
//!   currency coverage, and it belongs to all three rate kinds rather than two.
//!   An `amount` markup/discount or a `fixed` line on a `per_unit` row's
//!   `unit_rate` or on a `graduated`/`volume` row's bands has nowhere honest to
//!   record "not computable": `project_rate` refuses both magnitudes outright —
//!   whether or not the adjustment's `AmountSet` covers the row's currency,
//!   since a rate has no minor-unit floor to receive a currency delta against —
//!   and [`project_row`] reads that `None` as "leave the rate published". The
//!   escape `flat`/`package` have is not available: `TierBand::unit_price_rate`
//!   is a bare `RateMinor` with no absent state at all, and clearing a
//!   `per_unit` row's `unit_rate` — which *is* an `Option` — would author a row
//!   `rules::model_kind::check_amount_placement` refuses, since D-311 makes
//!   that field the one place such a row's money lives. So [`run_materiality`]
//!   measures a **zero** delta over such a row where `flat`/`package` would
//!   have reported `RowDelta::NotComputable` and been material regardless of
//!   threshold.
//!
//!   **What bounds it** is `infra::repricing::apply_rows_in`'s D-311 refusal,
//!   which covers all three rate kinds: a run whose
//!   adjustment cannot move a rate fails that row's whole plan
//!   (`inst-mr-apply`, D-134) and publishes nothing, so an understated verdict
//!   never becomes an unapproved change to a consumer-visible price — it is a
//!   run that reaches `completed_with_conflicts` having applied nothing, which
//!   is the outcome `rest_repricing_runs` pins. What is still unbuilt is a
//!   [`crate::domain::materiality::delta::RowDelta`] arm that says so, or a
//!   submit-time `ADJUSTMENT_CURRENCY_NOT_COVERED`-style refusal (the overlay
//!   plane's own check, unwired here) that would refuse the run at its own
//!   door instead of at the apply's — both decisions beyond this task's brief.
//! * **D-158's audit alignment:** opening a run appends a
//!   `create` record on the run's own chain
//!   (`audit_repo::bulk_operation_chain`), `subject_ref` its `operation_id`
//!   (`audit_repo::bulk_operation_ref`). The bulk import's open owes the
//!   identical record still; this change gave the token a writer on the
//!   repricing side only.
//! * **the two edges:** `chk_pricing_approval_subject_kind`
//!   admitted `bulk_operation` as of `pricing_migration`; `open_run_in` is now
//!   the writer that spends it, opening the approval unit with the identical
//!   `subject_kind`/`subject_ref` pair the `create` record above already
//!   carries (D-158).
//! * **Paid (`inst-mp-pending`, D-35's first half):** a selected row whose
//!   canonical key already holds a pending **interactive** unit is failed *per
//!   row* at selector time, naming that unit, and its key is withheld from what
//!   the run's own batch approval pins — see [`refuse_rows_on_a_held_key`]. This
//!   paragraph previously recorded the opposite as owed, and the cost was larger
//!   than "the per-row split does not exist yet" suggests: the run's own unit
//!   pinned every selected key, so one held key collided on
//!   `uq_pricing_approval_key_pending` and refused the **whole** `POST` — no run
//!   opened, and every other row of the batch was refused with it. D-35 decided
//!   both halves on one day and only the pinning half had been built, which is
//!   the shape where half a decision is worse than neither.
//! * **`inst-mp-grandfathered` clause 2** owes the per-row refusal of an
//!   explicitly-selected grandfathered row. The *selector* half is built (see
//!   [`RunSelector::admits_grandfathered`]): a selector that does not name the
//!   eligibility axis excludes the class. A selector that names it outright still
//!   expands over those rows and freezes them into the journal — because dropping
//!   them would be the silent skip the clause forbids, and a journal row cannot be
//!   *born* `failed` (D-261: the insert trigger admits only `pending`). The apply
//!   is therefore the only place that refusal can be written.
//!
//! # `run_id` is the idempotency column, and it is also the address
//!
//! §5's Idempotency cell for `POST /repricing-runs` is `run_id` — not a client
//! key header, which is why this surface declares **no** `Idempotency-Key` and no
//! `If-Match`. The run's `client_key` column holds it, so the store's
//! `(tenant_id, kind, client_key)` unique index is what makes a second `POST`
//! under one `run_id` answer the run it opened, exactly as
//! [`crate::api::rest::bulk_imports`] replays its own key.
//!
//! `GET /repricing-runs/{runId}` addresses the run by that same `run_id` rather
//! than by the server-minted `operation_id`, and that is the substantive choice
//! here. `inst-mr-return` makes the `GET` the progress endpoint; the caller who
//! needs it most is the one whose `POST` timed out and who therefore never saw a
//! response — and a progress endpoint keyed on an id that only the response
//! carries is unreachable for exactly that caller. Both ids are on the view, so
//! nothing is hidden.
//!
//! **The two spellings of "run id" are not the same value, and the collision is
//! the schema's rather than this module's.**
//! `pricing_repricing_journal.run_id` is a foreign key to
//! `pricing_bulk_operation.operation_id` — the *minted* id — while the API's
//! `run_id` is the caller's token in `client_key`. Nothing here can rename a
//! column; what it can do is never pass one where the other belongs, which is why
//! every journal call below takes `run.operation_id` explicitly.
//!
//! # The instant is checked at [`ChangeoverMoment::Submit`] and nowhere else here
//!
//! `inst-mr-api` gives the run's changeover the same two floors `inst-su-instant`
//! gives a supersession: strictly future at submit, and a whole
//! [`MAX_BATCHING_DELAY`](crate::domain::supersession::MAX_BATCHING_DELAY) ahead
//! at the **approval commit**. Only the first is this arm's — the second belongs
//! to a commit that does not exist — and the floor is
//! [`check_changeover_instant`]'s rather than a second copy of the bound, because
//! a hand-maintained second floor is how two mechanisms come to disagree about one
//! SLO. D-144's quantum is checked first, in `plan_supersession`'s order and for a
//! sharper version of its reason: the run freezes **one** instant for every
//! selected row, so a microsecond of precision that survived to the apply would
//! not fail one supersession, it would fail all of them.
//!
//! # `Bytes`, not `Json<T>`
//!
//! The body is parsed **after** the authz gate, this directory's standing
//! discipline: `Json<T>` runs as an extractor before the handler, so a caller
//! outside the scope with a malformed body would learn their body was malformed
//! instead of learning they were denied.
