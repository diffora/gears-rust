//! `/bss-pricing/v1/migrations` — scheduling, reading and cancelling a plan
//! migration (`inst-ms-api`, `inst-ms-return`, `inst-mg-cancel`, D-34).
//!
//! `api::rest::retirement`'s shape, and every argument that module makes about
//! this layer holds here verbatim and is not restated: why the body is parsed
//! **after** the gate, and why a mutating router carries D-178's correlation
//! edge.
//!
//! # What differs, and it is this module's own content
//!
//! **`DELETE` is a cancel, not a deletion.** §5 types the route `DELETE
//! /migrations/{id}` and D-34 rescopes what it means: the row is never removed,
//! it flips to `cancelled`. That is not a REST liberty — an executor re-reads the
//! schedule's state before each batch (`inst-mg-cancel`'s handshake), so a
//! deleted row would read as "no such migration" to the one party whose correct
//! behaviour is to **stop**. Absence and cancellation must not be one answer on
//! that lane, and the store refuses the `DELETE` statement outright to make sure
//! they never are.
//!
//! **The `202` is `inst-ms-return`'s and means what it says.** The catalog has
//! scheduled; nothing has migrated. Subscriptions creates the `PlanLink`s when
//! the effective date arrives and it calls `/start`. A `201` would claim a
//! resource whose whole content is a promise about the future.
//!
//! **A replay answers `200`, not `202`.** M2 makes the create idempotent on a
//! client-supplied `migration_id`, and a route that answered `202` to a retry
//! would tell a client it had just scheduled something it scheduled an hour ago.
//! The distinction is the only externally visible part of `inst-mg-idem`.
//!
//! **And a replay compares the request the key was spent on — all of it but the
//! instant.** `schedule_in`'s replay arm asks `migration_repo::StatedRequest`
//! (`source_plan_id`, `target_plan_id`, `scope`) before it returns the stored row,
//! so a resubmission under a spent `migrationId` naming a different plan pair or a
//! different subscriber scope is **409 `IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH`**, not a
//! `200`. `effective_at` is stated and deliberately **outside** the comparison, so
//! a resubmission that moves only the instant is still a replay and reads back the
//! stored schedule; two contract pins hold that, and whose decision it would be to
//! flip is recorded on `StatedRequest`.
//!
//! The body **is** compared: a resubmission naming a different pair, instant or
//! scope is not answered `200` with the stored schedule and its sender told nothing.
//! The narrower point stands, argued at [`crate::infra::migration::schedule_in`] —
//! this is the gear's only idempotent create that stores no request **digest**, so
//! the comparison is against the stored columns rather than against a record of the
//! body its requester sent. What this module owes is that the **published** contract
//! states what the door does; a description naming the wrong status is worse than a
//! stale comment, because clients are written against it.
//!
//! **The gate is `plan × migrate`.** Not `write` and not `retire`: §5 gives
//! migration its own action, and the authority to end a plan is not the authority
//! to move its subscribers onto another one.
//!
//! # Two routes of §5 are deliberately absent here
//!
//! `POST /migrations/{id}/start` and `/complete` — the D-65 Subscriptions
//! handshake. Their storage half is built and probed
//! (`migration_repo::start`/`complete`, persist-and-replay included), but the
//! routes are **not** mounted, because `/start` must run D-36's execution-time
//! re-resolution of the lock set and the boundary deltas, and that re-resolution
//! has no input in this system: the Contracts registry is absent and no
//! subscription is enumerable. A `/start` that returned an exclusion set computed
//! from nothing would hand Subscriptions a set it would honour as authoritative.
//! Left unmounted rather than mounted-and-lying; reported in the hand-back.

             and executes - this gear never mutates a subscription and never re-opens a posted \
             period. \
             \
             `migrationId` is **client-supplied** and is the idempotency key (M2): a timed-out \
             retry returns the original schedule and answers `200`, never a second schedule and \
             never `202`. A fresh schedule answers `202` - the catalog has scheduled and nothing \
             has migrated yet. \
             \
             **A replay must carry the request the key was spent on.** A resubmission under \
             a spent `migrationId` naming a different source or target plan, or a different \
             subscriber scope, is a different migration rather than a retry and is refused \
             `409 IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH`; nothing is scheduled and the stored schedule \
             is left as it stands. \
             \
             `effectiveAt` is the one stated field **outside** that comparison: a \
             resubmission that changes only the instant is still a replay and is answered \
             `200` with the **stored** schedule, so read that body before treating a \
             corrected date as applied. The remedy for a mistyped schedule is `DELETE \
             .../migrations/{migrationId}` and a **new** id, not a re-post under the old one, and \
             that holds for a `cancelled` or `completed` id too: the key is spent for good. \
             \
             The target MUST be **published** (`MIGRATION_TARGET_INVALID`), must not be the source \
             plan itself, and `effectiveAt` must clear the tenant's configured notice period - \
             default floor **60 days**, D-49 - or the request is refused \
             `MIGRATION_NOTICE_TOO_SHORT` with the earliest admissible instant named. There is no \
             override on this request: a shorter migration needs an audited change to the notice \
             policy first. \
             \
             Blocking deltas (entitlement overflow, invalid or missing-required add-ons, a target \
             missing the subscriber's frozen `(currency, region)` row of matching frequency) \
             refuse the schedule with `MIGRATION_BLOCKED` and are enumerated; **an unresolved \
             blocking delta never persists a schedule**. Contract-locked subscriptions are \
             different: they are reported and **excluded**, never blocking, because the lock is \
             never broken. \
             \
             **Read `subjectsUnresolved` and `exclusionsUnresolved` before trusting an empty delta \
             report.** The catalog holds no subscriptions and the Contracts lock registry has no \
             client in this deployment, so an empty report means nobody could be enumerated rather \
             than nobody having a problem. \

             before it begins execution and per processing batch thereafter - so a deleted row \
