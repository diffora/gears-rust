//! `GET /bss-pricing/v1/catalog-version/frontier` — the pin-eligibility
//! watermark (D-136; `design/01-foundation.md` §3.3 and §4.4).
//!
//! This is the entry point of the published read-model contract: a consumer
//! (Tariffs, Rating, Subscriptions, Billing, holding `plan x read` as a service
//! identity) reads the frontier **once**, pins its `catalog_version` for the
//! whole of a resolution or rating run, and resolves everything else at that
//! pin. Pin-eligibility is a version-level, prefix-closed predicate (D-101 +
//! D-114) no consumer can evaluate for itself, and D-136 makes it a stored
//! per-tenant watermark rather than a read-time recomputation, so this route is
//! a single point lookup, not a scan.
//!
//! The route is a read: it gates on `plan x read` with
//! `owner_tenant_id = None`, so the PDP derives the caller's scope and the
//! compiled `AccessScope` becomes the SQL-level tenant filter. A frontier
//! belonging to a tenant outside that scope is invisible rather than forbidden,
//! which is what keeps the surface from leaking whose catalog exists.
//!
//! The sibling `GET /catalog-version/refs/{pendingRef}` is the one-handle
//! status read. It is not this watermark: a caller holding a publish receipt
//! asks whether *that* handle committed, not where the tenant pin stands.

/// readings. Three things follow, and each of them argues against 404.
///
/// - A consumer must be able to distinguish "no publish has ever completed"
///   from "the frontier stands at version 0". Both are answered here without
///   ambiguity: `pin_eligible` is the discriminator, and `catalog_version` is
///   `null` in the first case and `0` in the second. A consumer never has to
///   infer the state from a missing field.
/// - This gear's 404 deliberately answers identically for "absent" and "outside
///   your scope" (`DomainError::NotFound`, so the surface leaks no existence).
///   Serving the empty frontier as a 404 would therefore make it
///   indistinguishable from a scope denial — exactly the discrimination the
///   contract requires, destroyed by the status choice.
/// - Consumers poll this endpoint at tenant onboarding, waiting for the first
///   publish to land. A 404 in that loop is normally an operational error and
///   attracts retry, backoff and alerting machinery; here it would be the
///   expected steady state of a healthy, freshly provisioned tenant.
///
/// The in-process contract (`bss_pricing_sdk::PricingCatalogClientV1`) **agrees**.
/// It does not return a `FailedPrecondition` here and its signature does not
/// promise a `PinFrontier`: it is
/// `-> Result<Option<PinFrontier>, CanonicalError>`, its `# Errors` section lists
/// only `PermissionDenied` and `Unavailable`, and its own doc says in as many
/// words that `None` is *"a **state, not an error** … deliberately **not folded
/// into an error**"*. So the wire's `200` with `pin_eligible: false` and the
/// trait's `Ok(None)` are one reading, not two.
///
/// Worth the correction because the trait has **no implementor**: whoever writes
/// the first one reads this file for the contract, and folding "nothing to pin
/// yet" into a refusal would meet every consumer as an outage at tenant
/// onboarding — the exact confusion both docs otherwise spend paragraphs
