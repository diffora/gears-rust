//! `POST /bss-pricing/v1/plans/{planId}/publish` — the entrance
//! (`02-plan-definition.md` §5, `01-foundation.md` §4.2,
//! `05-governance.md` §2).
//!
//! # One route, two acts, and the design set is what makes them one
//!
//! §5's Purpose cell reads *"Run fail-closed validation **+ submit for
//! approval/publish**"*, and the authz catalog spells the action
//! `publish (submit for publish)`. §2 step 1 then runs the
//! `MaterialityEvaluator` at *"publish submit"*, opens a unit when the change is
//! material, and step 5 says an approve makes *"the Foundation publish
//! continue"*. So the same call does one of two things depending on what the
//! subject already carries:
//!
//! - **no approved unit over this revision *and this content*** — validate,
//!   evaluate materiality, open a pinned unit, answer **202** carrying it. This
//!   is the submit;
//! - **an approved unit over this revision and this content** — mint
//!   [`PublishAuthorization::approved`] from it and call the commit, answer
//!   **200** carrying the receipt. This is §2 step 5's continuation.
//!
//! The alternative shape — the approve route driving the commit — was rejected:
//! it would make `approval × approve` sufficient to publish, and the matrix is
//! explicit that *"no role carries both `plan × publish` and `approval ×
//! approve`"*. Two authorities, two calls.
//!
//! **"And this content" is what keeps the route out of a dead end**, and it was
//! found by driving it. `inst-ap-pin` voids only `submitted` records, so an
//! approval survives a mutation of its own subject; a route that branched on
//! "does this revision carry an approval" would then take the commit arm every
//! time, be refused by the pin, and refuse **forever** — a price row's
//! `row_version` is inside the digest, so even restoring the old values does not
//! restore the old pin, and the plan's only escape would be abandoning the
//! revision. Matching the content instead means a moved subject simply has no
//! approval, so the route opens a fresh unit and a second person looks at what
//! is actually there. The security property is identical; the difference is that
//! an operator can act on the answer. The stale `approved` record is left
//! standing — `inst-as-immutable`, and it is the true record of a decision that
//! was made over content that never published.
//!
//! # Materiality is evaluated against the tenant's real policy, and the arm it
//! # could unlock is still not reachable — for a different reason
//!
//! This section used to say materiality "is a constant today", because `evaluate`
//! was called with a `None` threshold policy on the ground that
//! `GET/PUT /bss-pricing/v1/config/approval-threshold-policy` is not mounted. **It
//! is mounted** (`module.rs` merges its router), so the policy is now read through
//! `infra::threshold::effective_policy` and a tenant that has configured one sees it
//! in the stored verdict. D-10 is unchanged and is now the bootstrap rather than the
//! reason for a constant: the first threshold a tenant ever sets goes through this
//! very workflow.
//!
//! **The `AutoPublishable` arm below is still unreachable from this route, and the
//! reason is the D-88 supersession unit rather than the policy.** With a configured
//! policy, a plan-revision change set is one of exactly two things, because this
//! route authors through the **authoring** door and
//! `price_repo::insert_prepared` refuses a draft row on a key `find_key_occupant`
//! finds occupied — *"this is not the way to reprice an occupied key. That is the
//! D-88 supersession unit"*. D-88's row half, its compose and its cross-plane
//! commit are all built (`price_repo::insert_successor_draft_on` D-195,
//! `domain::supersession`, `infra::supersession`); its orchestrator, approval unit
//! and route are not, so nothing yet stages a moved row for this route to judge
//! (enumeration corrected 2026-08-05 — it read "the unit around it is not" for a day
//! after two thirds of the unit had landed):
//!
//! And the successor a staged supersession *does* leave on the plane is not this
//! route's to publish: `validated_draft_rows` excludes a draft whose key already
//! carries a published row, for the reason its own doc gives.
//!
//! * it carries a **draft** row, whose key therefore holds no published row, so
//!   `inst-mat-newrow` answers `rowWithoutBaseline` at step 3a; or
//! * it carries **no** draft row, so every row is published and unchanged, and
//!   D-115's pure-shape clause answers `alwaysMaterialTrigger`.
//!
//! So the threshold **comparison** — the row walk against a configured entry — has no
//! authorable subject on this path, and the arm below is written rather than
//! `unreachable!()` for that reason. It is reached from `infra::window`, whose change
//! sets are the published rows unchanged, and there always with a delta of zero. The
//! register entry that closes this is owed, not minted here.
//!
//! # The approve→commit window is closed **inside the commit**, not here
//!
//! `inst-ap-pin` scopes the TOCTOU void to a `submitted` record, so an approved
//! unit is not voided when its subject moves, and there is a real window between
//! the decision and this call. This handler does not check the pin and re-verify
//! it here: it *carries* the pinned digest on the authorization, and
//! [`PublishService::commit`] re-derives it inside the transaction that freezes
//! the content. A check made here would be a check the world can move behind —
//! and the commit's own compare-and-swap does not cover the gap, because it
//! swaps on the **revision's** row version while a price row edited inside the
//! window moves the **row's**.
//!
//! # What this route does check, and could not delegate
//!
//! `PublishAuthorization::approved` deliberately does not assert
//! `submitter != approver` (`domain::publish`'s module doc argues why the rule
//! keeps one owner). The record it is minted from was written under a store
//! CHECK and a domain rule that both refuse a self-approval, so this check has
//! no reachable failure through this gear's own paths — which is precisely why
//! it is written and unit-tested rather than assumed:
//! [`authorization_of`] is a pure function of a record, and
//! `publish_tests::an_approved_record_naming_one_principal_twice_is_refused_here`
//! constructs the record the store cannot hold.

             then does one of two things. With **no approved approval unit** over that exact \
             revision AND that exact content, it evaluates materiality, opens a pinned unit and \
             answers `202` - the submit. With one, it mints the publish authorization from that \
             record and commits, answering `200` with the receipt. An approval whose subject \
             moved after the decision covers content that no longer exists, so it does not \
             answer: the route opens a fresh unit and a second person looks at what is actually \
             there. Materiality is evaluated against the tenant's **configured** \
             approval-threshold policy (`GET/PUT /bss-pricing/v1/config/approval-threshold-policy`), \
             and configuring one is itself an always-material act (D-10), so a tenant that has \
             configured nothing has every publish material by rule rather than by omission. A \
             configured policy changes which rule answers and not yet the outcome: repricing an \
             occupied scope key needs the D-88 supersession unit, which this gear does not carry, \
             so a revision either adds a row with no baseline or moves no row at all - and both \
             are material whatever a threshold says. \
             \
             The `If-Match` precondition names the revision **and** its version. A second submit \
             while a unit is still `submitted` is `PENDING_CHANGE_UNIT_EXISTS` (409) - decide it \
             or withdraw it. The content approved is re-derived inside the commit's own \
             transaction and a mismatch is `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH` (409): the approve-to-commit \
             window is real, because the TOCTOU void closes only `submitted` records. A retired \
             plan answers `PLAN_RETIRED_NO_SUCCESSOR`, a plan whose every revision is \
             `abandoned` answers `PLAN_ABANDONED_NO_SUCCESSOR`, and a plan holding no open draft \
             answers `LIFECYCLE_FORBIDDEN`. Idempotency is per plan revision and is structural: \
             a revision has one edge out of `draft` and the commit's compare-and-swap refuses \

/// # The policy was `None`, and the justification for it was a false premise
///
/// This doc used to read: *"the tenant's approval-threshold policy … whose `GET/PUT
/// /bss-pricing/v1/config/approval-threshold-policy` surface is not mounted, so no
/// tenant can have one"*. **G6.5 mounted it** — `src/module.rs` merges the router and
/// `tests/rest_threshold_policy.rs` drives the whole round trip — so the premise was
/// already false when the sentence was written. The consequence was not cosmetic:
/// `infra::threshold::effective_policy`, the function whose own doc calls it *"the
/// fail-safe, executable"* and which `domain::materiality` names as "its production
/// caller", had **zero callers**, and every publish of every tenant answered
/// `noConfiguredThreshold` however the tenant had configured itself. A rule that
/// cannot be switched off is not a fail-safe; it is an absent feature that reads like
/// one.
///
/// It is read through a connection rather than a transaction, which is the same
/// reading `assemble_subject` takes one line above and for the same reason: the
/// materiality verdict is evaluated **once at submit** (§3 step 3) and the unit it
/// opens carries it as a value, so nothing later re-reads the policy and there is no
/// second read to disagree with. `infra::window`'s path is the one that needs the
/// transaction, because there the evaluation and the write are one act.
///
/// The other two arguments were always real: the change set is the rows this publish
/// would produce, and the baseline is the plan's currently published rows — `None`
/// when the plan has never published, which is `inst-mat-first`.
///
/// Both carry **whole rows** rather than scope keys, because D-115's delta domain
/// takes its operand off a row's content. A plan-revision publish is not itself a
/// registered trigger, so the change set is built with
/// [`ChangeSet::of_records`](crate::domain::materiality::ChangeSet::of_records);
/// what is registered about a revision is decided from its content, by
/// `triggers::triggered_by_content`.
