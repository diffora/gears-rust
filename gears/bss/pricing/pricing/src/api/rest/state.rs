//! Per-request state for the authoring surface, built once in `init()`.
//!
//! One struct for the plan plane and the price plane together, rather than one
//! per module, because the two share a transaction seam and a gate: a
//! `POST …/plans/{planId}/prices` reads the plan repository to check the row's
//! parent and writes through the price repository under the idempotency gate, so
//! splitting the state would mean two `Extension`s wired identically and a
//! handler picking the wrong one being a compile error nobody sees until a route
//! is added.
//!
//! The repositories are cheap clones over the same provider (each holds only a
//! `DBProvider`), so carrying four of them costs nothing beyond the handle. `db`
//! is here for [`crate::infra::idempotent`], which is the one thing on this
//! surface that opens a transaction of its own.
