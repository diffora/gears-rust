//! Slice 7's interactive repricing surface: `POST /plans/{planId}/supersessions`
//! (`inst-su-api`, D-88).
//!
//! One route, and it is the only way to reprice a **published** canonical scope key
//! interactively. What it composes is a single unit —
//! [`crate::infra::supersession::SupersessionService`] — so that the successor row, the
//! predecessor window's shorten and the successor window's schedule take **one**
//! approval rather than three: composing it from `POST …/prices` plus
//! `PATCH /price-windows/{id}` plus `POST …/windows` is three publish units with three
//! materiality evaluations, which is precisely what D-88 exists to collapse.
//!
//! # A module of its own, and that is the rule rather than a preference
//!
//! `api::rest::windows`' own doc states it: the route census keys on `pub fn router`
//! under `src/api/rest/**`, so **one module, one router, one census entry**. This route
//! is not a window surface — it authors a price row — and folding it into that module
//! would put a second subject under a doc whose whole first paragraph is about windows.
//! It shares `GovernanceState` because it holds the `CatalogVersion` registry handle,
//! which is the criterion [`crate::api::rest::state`] splits the two states on. This
//! gear now has **three** requesters of that one registry; `state`'s module doc carries
//! why three requesters is still one incrementer.
//!
//! # It answers **202** on both arms, and never 200 or 201
//!
//! `inst-su-return` says 202, and the reason is the window surface's: a publish unit is
//! not consumer-visible until `CatalogVersionPublished` + warm, so a 200 would claim the
//! price changed *for readers* when what changed is the truth side. A **201** would be
//! wrong for a second reason — the successor draft is created on the controlled arm too,
//! and a `Location` naming it would invite a caller to `PATCH` the row a reviewer is
//! looking at.
//!
//! `outcome` is the discriminator: `submitted_for_approval` when a second principal is
//! required, `superseded` when the unit committed. Two arms of one field rather than
//! two status codes, which is `WindowMutationOutcomeView`'s decision and the same
//! argument — neither arm can honestly answer 200.
//!
//! # The caller names the **predecessor row**, not the scope key
//!
//! `inst-su-api` offers both — *"the target scope key (or the current `priceId`)"* — and
//! the row id is taken. Three reasons, in order of weight: the key is ten axes and
//! re-spelling it on the wire is ten chances to name a key the caller did not mean,
//! while `PriceRowView` already hands the caller the id it is looking at; the row is
//! what the operator is actually superseding, so a row that has since left the published
//! plane is refused by name rather than resolving to a key whose occupant is a different
//! row; and the path's `{planId}` is then **checkable** against the row's own plan
//! rather than being decorative.
//!
//! # There is no `Idempotency-Key`, and that is §5's column rather than an omission
//!
//! §5 gives this endpoint an idempotency of **`(planId, scope key, changeover
//! instant)`** — the act's own identity — where the window `POST`'s column says *client
//! idempotency key*. So the key is natural and is paid inside the service: a second
//! request naming the same act is answered with the **same** pending unit rather than
//! `PENDING_CHANGE_UNIT_EXISTS`, and a request naming the same act with different
//! content is refused `DUPLICATE_SCOPE_KEY`.
//!
//! **Wiring `infra::idempotent` here keyed on the act would break the surface**, and the
//! reason is worth recording because the gate is right next door on the window `POST`.
//! The gate records the response body and replays it for every later arrival under one
//! key. The first call answers `submitted_for_approval`; the call made *after* an
//! independent approve is supposed to **commit**. Under a gate keyed on the act, that
//! second call would be handed the first call's recorded 202 and the unit could never be
//! committed at all. The window `POST` escapes this because its key is the *client's*,
//! and its own description says so in as many words: "completing an act a reviewer has
//! since approved is a new attempt and needs a new key."
//!
//! **DIVERGENCE, reported rather than fixed: the idempotency is natural up to the
//! commit and not past it.** A request replayed *after* the unit committed finds the
//! predecessor no longer the key's current row, and is refused —
//! `SUPERSESSION_WOULD_EMPTY_WINDOW` from `compose_windows`, because the successor's own
//! window now begins exactly at the changeover. That is a legible refusal and a safe direction (nothing is written), but
//! it is not the replay §5's column reads as. Making it one needs a stored response, and
//! a stored response needs a decision about what a replay of an act that was 202-then-
//! committed should say — which is the design set's, not this module's.
