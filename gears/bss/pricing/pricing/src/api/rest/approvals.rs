//! The approval surface — `design/05-governance.md` §5's four approval rows:
//! the reviewer's queue, the record, and the three decisions
//! (`inst-ap-decide`, `inst-as-approve`, `inst-as-reject`, `inst-as-void`).
//!
//! # The `GET` on one record carries the **pinned content**, and that is the
//! # whole reason it exists
//!
//! §3's reviewability invariant (D-61) is explicit: *"`GET
//! /bss-pricing/v1/approvals/{id}` MUST return the **pinned content** the
//! approval's `content_hash` covers (not the hash alone), so approval is never
//! hash-blind even where the subject resource is read-restricted"*. A reviewer
//! handed 32 bytes and an `approve` button is a signature on a digest, and the
//! two-person rule then certifies that somebody clicked.
//!
//! **What the store can and cannot give.** §6's `pricing_approval` carries a
//! `content_hash` and **no content column**, so there is no pinned document to
//! return: the only content this gear holds is the subject itself. So
//! [`ApprovalDetailView`] carries the subject **re-derived now** plus
//! [`ApprovalDetailView::content_matches_pin`], and the flag is not decoration —
//! it is the difference between "this is what was signed for" and "this is what
//! is there". On a `submitted` unit the two agree or the TOCTOU guard has
//! already voided the record, which is exactly the state a reviewer decides in.
//! Reported as a divergence rather than papered over: satisfying D-61 literally
//! needs a content column §6 does not declare.
//!
//! The rendering is the **authoring plane's own** — [`PlanPhaseView`],
//! [`AddonRuleView`], [`DescriptorSetView`], [`FrequencyView`],
//! [`PriceRowView`], [`ScopeKeyView`] — plus [`WindowIntervalView`], which is
//! `GET …/coverage`'s, so a reviewer reads the change set in the same shape the
//! author wrote it and the operator inspects it. A second rendering of one fact is
//! a second answer to it.
//!
//! [`PinnedContentView`] carries exactly the fields the pin hashes and no
//! others. `evaluated_at` and `baseline` are outside the digest
//! (`domain::approval::content_pin`'s module doc argues both), so putting them
//! here would show a reviewer content their signature does not cover. **The
//! conversion is an exhaustive destructure** and that is what keeps the sentence
//! true: it was dot-access until 2026-08-04, and `PlanShape::windows` walked
//! straight past it into the pin.
//!
//! # The three decisions declare no precondition header, and that is decided
//!
//! §5's idempotency cell for all three reads *per decision*, and the decision is
//! at-most-once **by construction**: `approval_repo`'s compare-and-swap carries
//! `state = 'submitted'` in its own predicate, so the second arrival is refused
//! `APPROVAL_NOT_PENDING` (409) whether it is a retry or a race. An `If-Match`
//! would be a second answer to a question the store already answers, over a
//! record that carries no version column at all; an `Idempotency-Key` would
//! store a response body for a replay the state machine makes unreachable. The
//! `POST`s therefore declare neither, and `tests/module_test.rs` asserts the
//! read routes declare none either.
//!
//! # `withdraw` is gated `approval × approve`, and no default role can reach it
//!
//! §3's endpoint map has one row for this whole path — *"`GET/POST
//! /bss-pricing/v1/approvals*` (S5) | `approval × read` / `approve`"* — so a
//! `POST` here is `approve`, and that is what this router enforces.
//!
//! **It is also a contradiction inside the design set, and it is reported
//! rather than resolved by widening the gate.** `inst-as-void` names the
//! withdrawer as *"the submitter (or a `CatalogAdmin`)"*; the role matrix in the
//! same section gives `CatalogAdmin` `approval × read` and deliberately **not**
//! `approval × approve` (*"it publishes, it does not approve itself"*), and a
//! submitter holds `plan × publish` under `FinanceManager` or `CatalogAdmin`,
//! neither of which carries `approve` either. So under the default matrix the
//! only principal who can withdraw a unit is a `FinanceReviewer`, who is neither
//! of the two the transition names. Gating on `read` instead would let anyone
//! who can see a unit close it, which is worse and is not what the map says.

/// # Adding a member to this shape is a wire change and **not** a pin change

/// The two are easy to confuse and the register has already paid for confusing

/// the **subject**, never this column, so no open unit becomes
/// `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH` either.

/// What it **is** is a read-compatibility question, and the answer is the reason
