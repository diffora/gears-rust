//! D-125's collection contract, decided once for every list surface this gear
//! serves: `limit` (server default 100, hard cap 1,000) plus an **opaque**
//! `cursor`, over a stable key order, with `next_cursor` on every page until the
//! result is exhausted.
//!
//! # Why a keyset walk and not an offset
//!
//! D-125 forbids offset pagination outright, and the reason is the store rather
//! than taste: these tables are append-only over a >= 7-year retention, so
//! `OFFSET n` names a different row every time somebody inserts ahead of it. A
//! keyset walk names a **row**, so an insert ahead of the cursor cannot shift
//! what the next page starts at.
//!
//! # The stability guarantee, and exactly where it stops
//!
//! D-125 promises a walk that "never skips or duplicates a row at or before the
//! cursor". A keyset walk on `price_id ASC` gives that for **inserts**: a row
//! inserted ahead of the cursor is simply not visited (it sorts before the
//! walk's position), and one inserted behind is visited once.
//!
//! It does **not** give it for a **delete**. Draft price rows are deletable
//! (D-141), and a row deleted behind the cursor was already returned to the
//! caller, while one deleted ahead of it is never returned at all. Neither is a
//! skip or a duplicate of a row *at or before* the cursor — the letter of D-125
//! holds — but a caller that walks a page set and reassembles it does not get a
//! snapshot, and no cursor over a mutable draft plane can give one. This is a
//! **deliberately absent** guarantee, stated so a reader does not assume it, not
//! a defect to paper over: providing it needs an MVCC snapshot held across
//! pages, which is a transaction spanning HTTP requests.
//!
//! # `prev_cursor` is always `None`
//!
//! [`toolkit_odata::PageInfo`] carries the field because other surfaces on the
//! platform use it. D-125 specifies a **forward** walk only, and a backward
//! cursor over an append-only store is a guarantee nothing here can keep: the
//! rows behind a cursor are exactly the ones a concurrent delete may have
//! removed, so a backward page would be answering about a set that no longer
//! exists. Serving `null` says so; serving a token that sometimes works would
//! not.
