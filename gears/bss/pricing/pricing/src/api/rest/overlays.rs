//! The `PriceOverlay` authoring surface — `design/09-price-overlays.md` §5,
//! `inst-pl-author` / `inst-pl-validate` / `inst-pl-return` / `inst-pl-commit`.
//!
//! Three routes: author or edit an overlay draft, submit it, and list them.
//!
//! # A save lands a **draft only**, and nothing publishes from it
//!
//! `inst-pl-return` is explicit (2026-07-28 review fix, confirmed 2026-07-31):
//! the `POST`/`PATCH` answers 201/200 and the overlay is a `draft`. Publishing
//! is the submit's, and the submit is **always material** (D-50) — overlay
//! creation, line add or remove, magnitude, kind, audience, precedence, dating
//! and disclosure changes all route through the Slice 5 approval workflow before
//! anything publishes. That is why this module's `POST` never touches the
//! lifecycle and why the submit answers **202**.
//!
//! # `PATCH` addresses a resource, so it is not the collection `POST`
//!
//! §5 spells both halves as `POST/PATCH /bss-pricing/v1/price-overlays` — one
//! path, two methods, the subject in the body. This mounts the `PATCH` as
//! `/bss-pricing/v1/price-overlays/{overlayId}` instead, for the reason Slice 8
//! reported for its own composition route (owed entry B-10): a precondition
//! addresses a resource, and a collection that answers `If-Match` is a
//! collection pretending to be one. The divergence is in the owed register
//! rather than smoothed over.
//!
//! # What `If-Match` carries here, and why it is not the plan's
//!
//! An overlay has **no plan**: D-92 gives it a revision chain of its own, so the
//! entity tag is the overlay revision's `"<revision>-<version>"` (D-170's shape)
//! and not a plan revision's. `BundleRepo`'s composition borrows the plan's tag
//! because a bundle rides a plan; nothing here does.
//!
//! # 422 does not exist on this platform
//!
//! §5 types seven of the nine overlay codes 422, and that notation is
//! architectural: `CanonicalError` renders `InvalidArgument`,
//! `FailedPrecondition` and `OutOfRange` all as **400**, and the **code string**
//! is the discriminator a consumer matches on. Those seven travel inside the
//! `ValidationFailed` envelope, one violation per failing rule, which is what
//! makes an overlay remediable in one pass.
//!
//! **The other two do not, and that is §5's own typing rather than a choice
//! here.** `PRECEDENCE_DUPLICATE` and `OVERLAY_INTERVAL_OVERLAP` are typed
//! **409**: they are conflicts on state a sibling overlay holds, which a caller
//! resolves by re-reading rather than by editing their own request. So
//! [`conflict_of`](crate::domain::overlay_rules::conflict_of) lifts either of
//! them out of the report and answers the typed conflict, and everything else
//! goes in the envelope. No route here declares a 422.

/// than one answer and one literal. It passes no policy and no baseline, and that is
/// not a shortcut — [`materiality::evaluate`] examines the **act** half before it

/// evaluator's own terms.
///
/// # This call is what makes `Trigger::PriceOverlayMutation` real
///
/// `Trigger::subject_exists_in_this_crate` answers `true` for this trigger, and for
/// an **act**-half trigger that predicate is a claim about a *declaration*: the act
/// half is `ChangeSet::act()`, reachable through nothing but [`ChangeSet::of_act`],
/// so a trigger no surface constructs can never be answered by the evaluator however
/// many tables its subject has. `domain::materiality::triggers`' module doc records
/// that at length for `GrandfatheringCutover`, whose store landed three commits
/// before its declaration and which stayed `false` throughout.
///
/// **A declaration is not the same as a `pub fn` that builds one**, which is the
/// sharper half and the reason this sits on a mounted route's path rather than in a
/// constructor beside the repository. `infra::bundle::composition_change_set` and
/// `rev_share_change_set` were exactly such constructors, with **no caller anywhere
/// in the crate**, while `BundleComposition` and `RevenueShareChange` answered
/// `true` on the strength of them (D-232). Both halves have since been settled and
/// neither by leaving the claim alone: `composition_change_set` gained its caller on
/// 2026-08-11, when `bundles::bundle_publish_materiality` gave the composition
/// publish this function's shape; `rev_share_change_set` gained one on 2026-08-16,
/// through `infra::bundle::declared_act`, which is what picks between the two acts
/// D-104 registers — and it could not have been written earlier for a reason worth
/// carrying here: until the verdict could name the trigger, the two declarations
/// rendered identical bytes, so the call would have been observable to the census
/// that reads for it and to nothing else (D-321).
