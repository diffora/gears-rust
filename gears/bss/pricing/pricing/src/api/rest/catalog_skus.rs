//! `GET /bss-pricing/v1/catalog/skus` — what the registry says this tenant sells.
//!
//! # A pass-through, and it says whose answer it is
//!
//! This gear owns no catalog. The route exists because the surfaces that author
//! a **meter** or bind a plan's **`sku_id`** cannot otherwise offer anything but
//! the values the tenant has already used, and a first row for a new SKU is
//! then typed from memory. So it reads
//! [`ProductCatalogClientV1`](crate::domain::ports::ProductCatalogClientV1) and
//! renders the answer, validating nothing: neither the meter nor the `sku_id`
//! is checked against this list anywhere, and pretending otherwise by filtering
//! here would imply a constraint the publish path does not enforce.
//!
//! # Why it answers 200 with a `source` instead of failing
//!
//! The ordinary state of this deployment is that no registry is wired, and a
//! pick-list with no suggestions is not an error — the operator types the value,
//! exactly as before this route existed. What would be an error is **saying the
//! catalog is empty**, because "the tenant sells nothing" and "nobody could be
//! asked" are opposite facts and only one of them is true here.
//!
//! So the body always carries `source`, and an unconfigured registry is
//! `source: "unconfigured"` with no items rather than a 503. The surface reads
//! the field and says which it is. The same distinction the migration surface
//! draws with `subjectsUnresolved`, and drawn the same way for the same reason.
//!
//! A registry that *is* configured and then fails is a different matter and does
//! answer 503: something was expected to reply and did not, and a caller
//! retrying is right.
