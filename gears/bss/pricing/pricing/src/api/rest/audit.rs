//! `GET /bss-pricing/v1/audit` — the Auditor read over the audit trail
//! (`design/05-governance.md` §5, `inst-au-read`; D-12, D-125, D-135, D-178).
//!
//! # Why this route exists, and what was wrong until it did
//!
//! `pricing_audit_log` had a writer and **no reader on any mounted surface**, and
//! `infra/error_mapping.rs` justifies dropping the detail from the three 403 arms
//! on the ground that the attempt is already on the table as a `deny` record
//! carrying the id — *"a durable trail rather than a log line"*. A compensating
//! control nothing can read is not one (Z13-8). The design set names this surface,
//! its permission, its audience and its pagination contract, so what landed is the
//! route it names and not one shaped here.
//!
//! # `audit × read`, which is the same pair `/history` asks for
//!
//! D-12 confines both to the Auditor, so the pair is shared and the **content is
//! not**: `/history` answers `pricing_price` rows with the authoring principal off
//! their own column, and this answers before/after states, the approval trail and
//! the correlation id. A reader who can see one can see the other by D-12's own
//! reading, and that is the decision rather than an accident of this route's
//! gating.
//!
//! # No correlation edge, and `frontier`'s reason
//!
//! D-178's edge is applied inside each **mutating** router. Nothing here writes an
//! audit record or an outbox row, so an `AuditStamp` would be a layer with no
//! reader. It **reports** correlation ids; it establishes none.
//!
//! # The cursor is the engine's, not [`crate::api::rest::cursor`]'s
//!
//! That token is a single id and this walk's position is an instant, a segment and
//! a position within it (D-135 makes `seq` per-segment). So the token is
//! [`crate::infra::audit_read::encode`]'s, exactly as `/history` takes its own
//! engine's — a route may name an engine type and `DE0202` refuses the reverse.
