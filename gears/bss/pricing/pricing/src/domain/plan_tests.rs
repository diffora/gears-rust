//! What the revision model has to keep true independently of storage.
//!
//! Deliberately one test. `PlanRevision`'s field set is exercised end to end in
//! `tests/sqlite_plan_repo.rs`, where a mapping that dropped or transposed a
//! column actually fails; its lifecycle predicates belong to `LifecycleState`,
//! which `lifecycle_tests.rs` already covers for all four states; and its
//! equality is a `derive`. Re-asserting any of those here would test the
//! language rather than a rule.
//!
//! What is left is the patch, and the part of it a compiler can hold.
