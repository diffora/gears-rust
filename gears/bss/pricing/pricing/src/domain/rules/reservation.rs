//! Slice 10's reserved-capacity attributes, as row-local rules
//! (`inst-rv-attrs`, `inst-rv-usage`, `inst-rv-level`; A1/A2, D-53, D-139).
//!
//! # Why these are row rules and not plan rules
//!
//! Every one of the three judges **one row against itself**: whether a
//! reservation may sit on this `chargeKind` at all, whether both halves of the
//! pair are present, and whether this row's `aggregationFunction` admits the
//! flavor. None reads another row, the plan, or any tenant state — which is D-21's
//! test for the save-time set, and it earns the author the refusal at authoring
//! rather than at publish.
//!
//! It also puts them where the **joint corpus** can reach them.
//! `examples/regen_registry/validator.rs` answers the corpus's publish cases by
//! running [`price_row_rules`](super::price_row_rules) and then the supersession
//! guard; it never assembles a `PlanShape`. A reservation rule registered into
//! the plan set would therefore have been unreachable from
//! `corpus/reserved/consumption-on-level-rejected.toml` — the case whose whole
//! purpose is to pin `LEVEL_RESERVATION_CONSUMPTION_FORBIDDEN`, and which had
//! carried `declined_until = "slice-10-advanced-primitives"` precisely because
//! no subject could reach the rule.
