//! The **supersession unit guard** (`inst-tb-supersession-units`; D-82, D-98,
//! D-122, D-127, D-129).
//!
//! The tier counter `Q` is derived per `(subscription, meter, dimensionKey,
//! window)` and belongs to the subscription's usage history, not to a price-row
//! version. Superseding a row therefore does **not** reset an in-window counter:
//! the successor's bands are simply applied to the continued `Q`.
//!
//! That continuity is what this guard protects. A successor landing on an
//! occupied published canonical scope key MUST NOT change the fields the
//! continued `Q` is **denominated in**, **derived from**, or **priced by** —
//! otherwise the same accumulated number is reinterpreted under a different
//! unit, read off a different stream, or re-priced under a different formula
//! mid-window:
//!
//! - `per_hour -> per_day` applies an hours-denominated `Q` to day-denominated
//!   bands: the D-77 factor-of-24 band-edge class, reintroduced through
//!   supersession.
//! - a changed `meter` or `dimensionKey` silently reads a different counter.
//! - a `graduated -> volume` / `package` flip re-prices the **already
//!   accumulated** window total under new math — `volume` applies the selected
//!   band's single rate to the whole window `Q`, including units already rated
//!   marginally under the predecessor (D-98).
//! - a changed `package_size` re-buckets an already-accumulated `used`, because
//!   rating counts blocks by a cumulative ceil-diff that presupposes one block
//!   size per window (D-122).
//! - a changed `carry` allowance would rewrite a **plan-scoped**,
//!   revision-immutable grant row that a supersession cannot open a revision to
//!   touch (D-129).
//!
//! Supersession is a **price** change on one key: new amounts, new bands. What
//! or how the key meters, and which formula prices it, is **structural** and
//! routes through plan revisioning and migration.
//!
//! ## The guard binds the key, not the mechanism (D-127)
//!
//! [`SupersessionUnitGuard`] takes a predecessor/successor **pair** and has no
//! notion of which mechanism produced it. That is the point. Both sanctioned
//! producers of `published -> superseded` are bound: the interactive
//! supersession unit, and the grandfathering cutover's `all_subscriptions`
//! successor, which lands on the predecessor's own scope key and inherits the
//! identical continued counter. Both set `supersedes_price_id` on the successor,
//! which is what pairs the two rows here.
//!
//! Before D-127 the rule was invoked from the supersession unit alone, so a
//! cutover successor could flip `per_hour -> per_day` — the same band-edge class
//! through its fifth door, on the one path that is always material and therefore
//! felt safe. A signature that asked "which mechanism?" would reopen exactly
//! that hole, so this one cannot ask.
//!
//! ## The seven unit axes are shared, not restated
//!
//! **Seven axes, eight labels** (D-317, review Z23-1). The first axis is reported
//! under one of two names — `model_kind` when the authored kind moved, and
//! `includedAllowance (presented modelKind)` when it did not and the *compiled* kind
//! did (D-130's two-band ladder). They are an `if`/`else if` on one axis, so a
//! single answer carries at most seven labels, which is why the arithmetic below
//! still reads seven.
//!
//! Supersession is not the only handover that leaves `Q` running. A **phase
//! conversion** does too — the counter is phase-blind, so the row serving the
//! meter after conversion inherits the continued counter — and
//! `inst-ph-override-units` (D-89, extended by D-122) states the same
//! requirement over the same seven axes for a phase-scoped usage override.
//!
//! So the seven live in one place,
//! [`unit_determining_mismatch`](crate::domain::price_row::unit_determining_mismatch),
//! and both guards call it:
//! [`SupersessionPair::mismatched_unit_fields`] appends the three this guard
//! adds, and
//! [`PhaseOverrideUnits`](crate::domain::plan_rules::phase_graph::PhaseOverrideUnits)
//! uses the seven axes as they stand. A second hand-maintained copy of that list is
//! how the factor-of-24 class re-enters through its next door — the D-127 point
//! restated at field granularity: a guard must not be able to differ by which
//! mechanism asked, and one that can drift already differs.
