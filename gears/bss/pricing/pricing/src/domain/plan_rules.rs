//! The Slice-2 **plan-shape rule codes** (`design/02-plan-definition.md` §5).
//!
//! The sibling of [`crate::domain::rules`], and the same contract: the `const`
//! codes below are the machine-readable discriminators the design set names
//! **verbatim** in §5, they are what an RFC 9457 response carries and what the
//! conformance corpus asserts against — so they are written once, here, and
//! referenced at every `report.violate` site rather than spelled at each call
//! site. A code spelled twice is a code that can be spelled two ways.
//!
//! The four validators of this slice — `CycleShapeValidator`,
//! `CompositionValidator`, the `PhaseGraph` rules and the `DescriptorSet` rules
//! — each register their own
//! [`ValidationRule`](crate::domain::validation::ValidationRule)s over a
//! [`PlanShape`](crate::domain::plan_shape::PlanShape) into the Foundation's
//! fail-closed pipeline. They append and never short-circuit: a plan with a
//! broken phase chain *and* an incomplete descriptor set reports both, because
//! an author remediates a plan in one pass.
//!
//! **No code is declared here that nothing emits.** Every `const` below has a
//! rule behind it in this group; the ones §5 names and this gear cannot enforce
//! are enumerated in the next section instead, because a `const` for an
//! unraised code reads as enforcement to everyone who greps for it.
//!
//! ## Codes referenced and never redefined
//!
//! The revision-lifecycle refusals — `LIFECYCLE_FORBIDDEN`,
//! `PLAN_RETIRED_NO_SUCCESSOR`, `OPEN_DRAFT_REVISION_EXISTS`,
//! `PLAN_ABANDONED_NO_SUCCESSOR`, `STALE_VERSION`, `DUPLICATE_SCOPE_KEY` — are
//! **Foundation-owned** (§3.3) and are referenced from this slice, never
//! redeclared (R-11).
//!
//! ## What is deliberately absent
//!
//! The precedent is [`crate::domain::rules`]'s own absence section: *a rule
//! that always passes is indistinguishable from a rule that holds*. Six of the
//! codes §5 names are **not** declared here, and five of the six share one
//! reason — they are reads against the product/SKU registry read model, and
//! this gear has no registry client at all ([`crate::domain::ports`] holds the
//! `CatalogVersion` registry and nothing else).
//!
//! | Code | Why absent |
//! |---|---|
//! | `SKU_NOT_PUBLISHED` | the parent SKU's publication state lives in the product/SKU registry read model |
//! | `PLANTIER_DIVERGENT` | needs the parent SKU's `PlanTier`, from the same registry. The `PLANTIER_MISSING` half needs nothing external and **is** implemented |
//! | `ADDON_INCOMPATIBLE` (registry half) | "add-on SKUs published + compatible with the base SKU" is a registry read. The **plan-authored** half — an edge pointing outside the plan's own add-on set, and a conflicting pair with both sides `required` — needs nothing external and **is** implemented under this code, because D-16 made those edges plan-authored |
//! | `ADDON_OVERRIDE_UNRESOLVED` | needs two things this gear does not have: the add-on SKU's plans (a registry join) and `PriceWindow` coverage for the covering-member-key half (Slice 7 storage, D-95 / D-97 / D-116) |
//! | `METER_USAGE_TYPE_UNBOUND` | the registry metering-unit declaration's `usageTypeRef` (UC3(a)) |
//! | `METER_DIMENSION_UNDECLARED` | the `UsageType`'s declared `metadata_fields` keys (UC3(c)) |
//!
//! **A seventh absence, and the only one the design set names no code for at
//! all.** `inst-cs-customfreq` states two requirements. `n > 0` and
//! `n <= cap` is implemented, under [`INVALID_CUSTOM_INTERVAL`]. Anchor
//! compatibility — `customEveryN Days(n)` MUST anchor `subscription_start` —
//! is not, because `billing_anchor_policy` is a **Slice-6** `pricing_price`
//! column (`06-consumer-contracts.md` §6) that does not exist in this schema
//! and must not be added here. Adding it would be Slice 2 minting Slice 6's
//! column, and the rule over it would then belong to whichever slice built it
//! first. Stretching [`INVALID_CUSTOM_INTERVAL`] to cover the anchor half was
//! rejected for the same reason `SETUP_ROW_INVALID` does not absorb the
//! `billingTiming` check: a code reported for something §5 does not say it
//! reports is a code no consumer can act on.
//!
//! **The eighth and ninth are signals rather than codes.**
//! `inst-cmp-tier-drift` and the drift arm of `inst-cmp-usagetype` both consume
//! a **registry change signal** this gear has no lane for — no inbound port, no
//! subscriber, no job — and both write the operator-plane flag store rather
//! than failing a publish. That store **exists**: `pricing_operator_flag` is a
//! table on both backends (D-85) carrying both flag names in its `CHECK`
//! already, and it has no repository. The absence is therefore the *signal*,
//! not the storage — worth stating, because a reader who finds the table would
//! otherwise reasonably conclude the feature is wired.
//!
//! ## Rules cross-referenced here and registered elsewhere
//!
//! Three requirements Slice 2's instructions state are **owned by other
//! slices**, and a second registration of any of them is two owners of one
//! rule, free to disagree:
//!
//! - `billingTiming` REQUIRED on every recurring row is **Slice 6's**
//!   (`inst-cs-recurring` says so in as many words: cross-referenced here,
//!   never re-registered);
//! - `billingGranularity` on all usage rows and `tierAggregationWindow` on
//!   tiered / `package` rows are **already implemented** as Slice 3's
//!   [`EVAL_POLICY_MISSING`](crate::domain::rules::EVAL_POLICY_MISSING), which
//!   `inst-cs-usage` cross-references;
//! - `taxCategory` is each row's Slice-4 `tax_category_ref` (D-110) — never a
//!   descriptor-set column and never a Slice-2 check.
