//! ISO 4217 money primitives: the validated [`CurrencyCode`], its minor-unit
//! scale, and the non-negative [`MinorAmount`].
//!
//! **This gear computes no charge.** It authors, validates and freezes price
//! rows; the arithmetic that turns a row into an amount owed lives in Tariffs
//! (evaluation) and Billing (invoicing). So there is deliberately **no add,
//! subtract, multiply, allocate or round here** — only the checks a publish
//! needs. A helper that added two `MinorAmount`s would invite exactly the
//! second implementation of charge arithmetic the design set puts downstream,
//! and the sibling ledger already owns the rounding and allocation idiom for
//! the money that is actually posted.
//!
//! Amounts are integer minor units (`amount_minor`), never a float and never a
//! decimal type. The per-currency **scale** is the ISO 4217 minor unit: there is
//! no flat two-decimal rule — JPY takes 0 and BHD takes 3 — which is why
//! `PRECISION_EXCEEDED` is declared a first-class publish rejection rather than
//! a rounding decision taken quietly at the boundary.
//!
//! # `PRECISION_EXCEEDED` is declared, and on the amount plane it is dormant
//!
//! Stated here because three design documents describe it as live enforcement —
//! `design/01-foundation.md` §3.3, `03-price-structure.md` §§ error sets,
//! `04-currency-tax.md` — and a reader checking whether
//! `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-fr-price-amount-validation` is satisfied would otherwise
//! be told "yes, by these" about functions nothing calls.
//!
//! **[`check_scale`], [`check_decimal`] and [`is_expressible`] have no caller in
//! this gear.** That is not an oversight and relaxing or deleting them would not
//! be the repair: the barrier is *representational*. Every amount reaches this
//! module as an `i64` count of minor units (`PriceContentView::amount_minor` →
//! [`MinorAmount::new`]), so no request can *declare* a scale for the rule to
//! compare, and a [`crate::domain::price_row::PriceRow`] cannot hold a violation
//! of it — the argument [`crate::domain::publish::rules`] makes for registering
//! no pipeline rule, and the one D-311 restates ("there is no check to relax,
//! and relaxing one would change nothing").
//!
//! **What owes the call is the first authoring surface that takes a decimal
//! literal**, in either scale: [`check_decimal`] for an amount, and
//! [`RateMinor::from_decimal`] — which carries the *rate* scale's own comparison
//! and not [`check_scale`]'s — for a rate. D-311 staged that surface and has not
//! built it: the rate wire spelling it chose is the integer `unitRateNanoMinor`,
//! read back through [`RateMinor::from_nano_minor`], so today
//! [`RateMinor::from_decimal`] is reached only from `domain::repricing_tests`. A
//! CSV or major-unit bulk import is the obvious first such surface, and the point
//! of recording this is that it will **not** reach the check by default.
