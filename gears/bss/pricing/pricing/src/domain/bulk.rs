//! The bulk run's vocabulary — what kind of run it is and where it stands
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §4, §6; D-260, D-267).
//!
//! # The states are here and the **edges are not**
//!
//! `pricing_bulk_operation`'s trigger is the state machine, on both engines, and
//! the entity says so: "the edges between them are the table's trigger, not a
//! caller's convention". A `may_move_to` on [`BulkState`] would be a second
//! spelling of a rule the store already enforces, and the two would drift the
//! first time a state is added — which has happened once already, `rejected`
//! arriving four migrations after the table.
//!
//! So this module carries the tokens and nothing else: a caller names a state,
//! the store decides whether the move is legal, and the refusal it raises is the
//! one message an operator sees.
//!
//! # An import can never be `awaiting_approval`
//!
//! A `CHECK` says so (`NOT (kind = 'import' AND state = 'awaiting_approval')`),
//! because D-137 makes a bulk import never material: D-118 pinned it to the draft
//! plane, and materiality is evaluated at a *publish* against a published
//! baseline. The state exists for mass repricing, whose rows are published.
