//! Tests for the phase-schedule rules.
//!
//! Every rule is judged **alone**, through [`judge`], because the ten of them
//! overlap by design: a two-terminal graph is both an integrity fault and a
//! nonlinear chain, and a row on an unattached phase is both `PHASE_ROW_ORPHANED`
//! and — through the phase it leaves uncovered — `PHASE_UNCOVERED`. A suite that
//! ran the whole pipeline could not say which rule caught what. Each arm below is
//! written so that deleting the arm from the rule turns the test red - a rule with
//! many arms and a suite proving only the happy path proves nothing at all.
//!
//! The fixtures are deliberately *clean* in every dimension a test is not
//! attacking: `linear_chain` is duration-correct, ordinal-correct and
//! evergreen-terminal, so a violation a test asserts can only have come from the
//! one thing it broke.
