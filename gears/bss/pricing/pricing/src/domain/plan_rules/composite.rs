//! Slice 10's derived (composite) meter — the two rules that need no
//! counterparty (`inst-cm-constituents`' arity half, `inst-cm-formula`'s
//! self-reference half).
//!
//! # Why these are `PlanShape` rules and not row-local ones
//!
//! A composite is plan-shape configuration, and the self-reference walk ranges
//! over **the revision's whole composite set**: §9's acceptance criterion asks
//! for direct *and transitive* self-reference to be rejected, and a transitive
//! cycle is `A → B → A` across two definitions. A row-local rule sees one
//! definition and can only find the direct case, which is the half that matters
//! least.
//!
//! # The third rule of `inst-cm-constituents` is not here, and that is measured
//!
//! *"≥ 2 **published** constituent `meteringUnit` ids (registry-declared)"* — the
//! publication half has no operand. `metering_unit` / `MeteringUnit` appear
//! nowhere in `src/`, `PriceRow::meter` is a free `Option<String>` validated
//! against nothing, and this gear holds no registry client at all
//! ([`crate::domain::ports`] carries the `CatalogVersion` registry and nothing
//! else). `COMPOSITE_CONSTITUENT_UNPUBLISHED` is therefore declared in S10 §5 and
//! **not raised anywhere**, exactly as `plan_rules` names `SKU_NOT_PUBLISHED` and
//! `contracts` names `GRANT_REF_UNDEFINED`: a rule over an empty lookup either
//! refuses every composite ever authored or passes every one, and a rule that
//! always passes is indistinguishable from a rule that holds.
//!
//! `inst-cm-output-unit` is likewise absent because it is not this gear's act at
//! all — declaring the output unit is the registry's (D-32).
