//! One case per clause of the two period floor/cap rules (**D-319**).
//!
//! Every refusal here is paired with a positive control, and the controls are
//! not decoration: a refusal test can be green because the rule fired for the
//! wrong reason, or because the subject was unpublishable before the case
//! touched it. So each case asserts both that the offending shape is refused
//! and that the shape one edit away from it is accepted.
