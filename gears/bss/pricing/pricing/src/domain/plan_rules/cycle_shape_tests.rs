//! Tests for the billing-cycle shape rules.
//!
//! Every rule here has arms, and an arm is what a test covers: a rule whose

//! boundary is pinned on both sides (366 days passes and 367 fails, 24 months
//! passes and 25 fails), each missing part of a hybrid is named separately, and
//! D-84 is exercised through the two shapes that hid the defect — a hybrid
//! whose usage reaches one of two sold markets, and a usage-only plan pricing
//! two meters where only one of them reaches both.
