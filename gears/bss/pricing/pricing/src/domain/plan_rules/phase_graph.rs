//! The **phase-schedule rules** (`cpt-cf-bss-pricing-algo-phases`).
//!
//! Ten rules over a [`PlanShape`], each one an instruction of the slice:
//! `inst-ph-graph` (in three halves), `inst-ph-duration`, `inst-ph-trial`,
//! `inst-ph-row-attached`, `inst-ph-coverage`, `inst-ph-usage-invariant`,
//! `inst-ph-override-units` and `inst-ph-terminal-stable`. They append and never
//! short-circuit, so a plan with a broken chain *and* an uncovered phase reports
//! both.
//!
//! Three of the ten implement `inst-ph-graph`, which §5 splits into three
//! problem responses, so their
//! [`name`](crate::domain::validation::ValidationRule::name)s carry a suffix -
//! `inst-ph-graph`, `inst-ph-graph/linear`, `inst-ph-graph/terminal-kind`. The
//! name is what the pipeline attributes a failing rule by, and three rules
//! answering to one name would make the attribution useless exactly where the
//! codes are already three.
//!
//! ## Terminality is structural, and it is derived in exactly one place
//!
//! Every rule here asks [`PhaseGraph`] which phase is terminal, which is the
//! entry, and what the ordinal order is. None of them re-derives any of the
//! three. That is the point of the accessors: four rule sets each free to answer
//! "which phase is terminal" its own way would eventually disagree, and a
//! disagreement between two derivations of one fact is invisible — both readings
//! look right at their own call site.
//!
//! ## The chain is linear, and that is stronger than acyclic
//!
//! `inst-ph-graph`'s 2026-07-31 review fix. Acyclicity plus a single terminal
//! admit a **dead phase**: one nothing converts into, which still demands
//! coverage rows under `inst-ph-coverage`, and which leaves "first" undefined
//! for the two readers that need it — `inst-cs-setup-timing` charges setup at
//! entry into "the first non-trial phase", and D-39 computes migration entry the
//! same way. So the ordinal order is **normative**, the entry phase is the
//! **lowest** ordinal, and every non-terminal phase converts into the next phase
//! in that order.
//!
//! A duplicate ordinal is reported by the same rule, and for the same reason: it
//! is not a total order, so "the lowest ordinal" names two phases and the entry
//! is undefined again — through the tie rather than through the topology.
//!
//! ## The terminal phase's kind
//!
//! C-4. Terminality is `converts_to_phase_id IS NULL` while `kind` is an
//! independent column admitting `trial | intro | evergreen`, so before this rule
//! nothing rejected a `trial`-terminal chain — which leaves "the first non-trial
//! phase" undefined for *both* readers above and collides with the
//! `display_trial_days = phase_duration_days` CHECK, since a terminal phase may
//! carry no duration at all. **Intro pricing forever is an `evergreen` terminal
//! phase priced at the intro rate, never an `intro` terminal**; that sentence is
//! the authoring answer this rule owes, so it is also in the rejection detail.
//!
//! ## Usage rows are phase-invariant, and an override inherits the counter
//!
//! One usage row on the terminal phase covers every phase (D-15/D-19); a usage
//! row on a non-terminal phase overrides it **for that phase**. Two rules guard
//! the override, and each closes a different hole:
//!
//! - **Its base must exist** (`PhaseOverrideBase`, D-117). Without the base the
//!   D-89 unit guard has no comparison target at all; D-84's per-market
//!   completeness exempts the line entirely, because phase-scoped overrides are
//!   additive; and after the phase converts the line resolves to **nothing**, so
//!   usage that keeps arriving fails closed on a published, sellable plan. That
//!   is "sold but unrateable" through the override door.
//! - **Its denomination must match** (`PhaseOverrideUnits`, D-89 extended by
//!   D-122). The tier counter `Q` is keyed
//!   `(subscription, meter, dimensionKey, window)` and is **phase-blind**, so a
//!   conversion never resets it: a `per_hour` trial row converting into a
//!   `per_day` evergreen row mid-window applies an hours-denominated counter to
//!   day-denominated bands — the D-77/D-82 factor-of-24 class through the phase
//!   axis — and a changed `package_size` re-buckets an already-accumulated
//!   `used`. Free-trial pricing stays fully expressible: a zero rate, or a zero
//!   band set, **at the same denomination**.
//!
//! The seven fields the second rule compares are
//! [`unit_determining_mismatch`], shared with the supersession guard rather than
//! restated. Both rules are one question asked of two mechanisms — "does the
//! continued counter still mean what it meant?" — and the D-127 lesson is that
//! such a guard must not be able to differ by which mechanism asked.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately absent
//!
//! The precedent is [`crate::domain::rules`]'s own absence section: *a rule that
//! always passes is indistinguishable from a rule that holds.*
//!
//! - **`inst-ph-map` and `inst-ph-default` are not rules.** The phase-to-price
//!   map and the auto-created implicit terminal phase are a projection and a
//!   creation-time act; there is nothing for a validator to reject. The rows'
//!   `phase` axis is typed [`PhaseId`] by construction (D-19), so the axis-typing
//!   half is carried by the type rather than by a check — **and the type carries
//!   only that much.** `PhaseId` says "this is a phase id" and not "this
//!   revision's", which is the gap [`RowPhaseAttached`] closes (D-337): a draft
//!   whose every row keyed on an id nobody attached was refused for having no
//!   terminal phase and never told about the rows.
//! - **`inst-ph-trial` used to be listed here as absent, and it is a rule.** The
//!   withdrawn argument was that `displayTrialDays` is a read-model projection
//!   whose equality with `phase_duration_days` a `CHECK` on `pricing_plan_phase`
//!   guarantees. D-151 measured that: the `CHECK` is silent on `kind` and, by
//!   NULL propagation, satisfied whenever `phase_duration_days` is NULL, so the
//!   shape it exists to forbid passed it. [`DisplayTrialDaysOnTrialPhase`] is
//!   what closes both halves.
//! - **Reachability is not walked.** `PhaseChainLinear` requires every
//!   non-terminal phase to convert into its ordinal successor, which makes the
//!   whole set reachable from the entry phase by construction — a separate walk
//!   could only ever agree, and a check that cannot fail is not a check. The
//!   unreachable phase the design names is reported through the edge that
//!   strands it.
//! - **The per-market half of the override base is D-84's.**
//!   `PhaseOverrideBase` asks whether the `(meter, dimensionKey)` line has a
//!   phase-invariant home at all — the question `inst-ph-usage-invariant` asks,
//!   which is why the design has it name the line and the phase and not a
//!   market. Whether that home exists in **every** sold market is
//!   `USAGE_MARKET_INCOMPLETE`, whose scope is exactly the terminal-phase rows.
//!   Two owners of one requirement are free to disagree.
