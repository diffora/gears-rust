//! The plan-level period floor and cap
//! (`cpt-cf-bss-pricing-algo-period-floor-cap`, **D-319**).
//!
//! Two rules over a [`PlanShape`]'s [`period_floor_caps`] set: the bound is
//! authored on a market the plan actually sells, and each bound is a usable
//! amount.
//!
//! [`period_floor_caps`]: PlanShape::period_floor_caps
//!
//! # What this gear does with the value: nothing
//!
//! The floor and the cap are **period-level phases over the aggregated total**,
//! applied after per-line emission. Rating resolves them from the pinned
//! snapshot and emits a `PeriodFloorCapObligation`; **Billing** executes
//! `max(total, floor)` / `min(total, cap)` and rounds. This gear authors,
//! validates and freezes — the deferred half of PRD §17.8 — and adds no
//! evaluation machinery, which is the shape `STRIPE-GAP-ANALYSIS.md` G-3
//! predicted the row would activate in.
//!
//! # Why the amount rule exists when the column already carries the `CHECK`
//!
//! All four amount faults — a non-positive floor, a non-positive cap, a floor
//! above its cap, and an entry authoring neither — are `CHECK`s in
//! `m20260802_000079_create_pricing_plan_period_floor_cap`, so the write path
//! refuses them and this rule can only fire on a row that reached the table
//! another way. It is registered anyway, and **D-150** is the precedent and the
//! argument: the add-on quantity bounds were a `CHECK` with no code, so an
//! author met an unsatisfiable selection as a driver error rather than as a
//! report line naming the offending bound. The constraint is the guarantee and
//! the rule is the explanatory path — the arrangement D-148 describes — and a
//! rule that is unreachable through the authoring door is the *intended* state
//! here, not an oversight.
//!
//! # Why the market rule cannot be a `CHECK`
//!
//! "This bound's `(currency, region)` is one the plan sells" is a property of
//! the plan's **row set**, not of the bound row: the market set is the union
//! over `pricing_price`'s scope keys, which no constraint on this table can
//! see. It is `PERIOD_FLOOR_CAP_MARKET_UNSOLD` at publish, in the same family
//! as `BASE_MARKET_INCOMPLETE` and `USAGE_MARKET_INCOMPLETE` — and pointing the
//! other way. Those two ask whether every sold market carries the rows it owes;
//! this one asks whether an authored bound has a market to apply in. A floor
//! authored on `(USD, us)` by a plan selling `(USD, ca)` is not a smaller floor,
//! it is **no floor at all**, frozen for the seven-year horizon into an
//! immutable snapshot, and the author who wrote it believes their plan has a
//! minimum.
//!
//! The converse is deliberately **not** a rule: a sold market with no bound is
//! the ordinary plan, and requiring one would make every plan in the catalogue
//! author a minimum.
