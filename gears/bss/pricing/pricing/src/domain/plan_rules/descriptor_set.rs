//! Billing descriptor completeness (`cpt-cf-bss-pricing-algo-descriptors`).
//!
//! One rule over a [`PlanShape`]: the descriptor set a publish would freeze
//! carries every element the **tenant** requires (D-48's pinned three, plus
//! whatever their `pricing_policy_object` entry adds — D-152), and the report
//! names **each** missing one rather than the first. `inst-ds-required` says
//! "publish blocks on any missing element with the field named", and an author
//! remediates a plan in one pass — a rule that stopped at the first absence
//! would send them round the pipeline once per missing field.
//!
//! ## Three of D-48 v1's five elements, and the other two have owners
//!
//! D-48 pinned a five-element v1 contract. Two of the five are **row-borne** and
//! are deliberately not checked here — this is Global Constraint 5's third arm,
//! and the whole of the reason:
//!
//! - **`billingTiming` on every recurring row is Slice 6's registered rule.**
//!   `inst-cs-recurring` says so in as many words ("cross-referenced here, never
//!   re-registered; single owner, 2026-07-28 review fix").
//! - **`taxCategory` is each row's `tax_category_ref`** (Slice 4
//!   `inst-td-persist`, sole source of truth per D-110). A per-plan mirror of it
//!   was removed precisely because the consistency check meant to reconcile the
//!   two was undefined whenever two rows of one plan carried different
//!   categories.
//!
//! `inst-ds-required` does say publish blocks "with the row named" for those
//! two. **That naming belongs to their owners' rules**: re-checking either here
//! would be a second owner of one rule, free to disagree with the first, and the
//! disagreement would be invisible — both readings look right at their own call
//! site. What this rule owns is the three descriptor-set fields plus whatever a
//! tenant adds to them.
//!
//! **That gap is now closed** (Slice 4, `m20260802_000037`): `pricing_price`
//! carries `tax_category_ref`, and the owner this rule defers to is
//! `domain::tax_display::TaxBasisComplete`, whose category arm blocks publish
//! unconditionally when the effective category resolves to nothing (D-154). The
//! paragraph here previously said the column did not exist and that nothing
//! checked the element; both were true when written and neither is now.
//!
//! ## `inst-ds-sufficient` is not a rule here
//!
//! "The frozen set MUST be sufficient for Billing/ERP to post without
//! re-querying mutable rows" is a property of the **frozen snapshot** — of what
//! the publish unit writes and what a consumer can resolve from it — not of the
//! draft this pipeline judges. It belongs to the read-model projection (G6). A
//! rule here could only re-assert the required-set it already checks, which is
//! the shape of a rule that always passes.
