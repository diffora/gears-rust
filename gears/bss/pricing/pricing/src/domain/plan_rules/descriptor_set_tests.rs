//! Tests for `inst-ds-required`.

//! The rule has one job with two halves: report **every** missing element, and
//! resolve each element from exactly one place. Both halves fail silently if
//! they fail at all — a rule that stopped at the first absence still reports a
//! violation and still blocks the publish, and a required field satisfied from
//! the wrong home still passes — so each is asserted rather than inferred from
//! "the publish was blocked".
