//! Billing-cycle shape rules (`cpt-cf-bss-pricing-algo-cycle-shape`).
//!
//! Six rules over a [`PlanShape`], each registered under its own instruction
//! id. Most of them are review fixes with a named defect behind them, and each
//! doc below carries the defect rather than a restatement of the code: a rule
//! restated without its defect is a rule reimplemented without its guard, and
//! the guard is the only part of it a later edit can silently drop.
//!
//! ## Why the subject is the whole plan and not a row
//!
//! Slice 3's rules are **row-local** (D-21) and judge one
//! [`PriceRow`](crate::domain::price_row::PriceRow) at a time. None of these
//! can be: `HYBRID_INCOMPLETE` is a statement about a row *set*, D-84's
//! completeness is a statement about a set of markets crossed with a set of
//! priced lines, and the setup-row rule has to read the plan's billing cycle to
//! decide whether the row may exist at all. So the subject is the whole
//! [`PlanShape`], which is also where the published baseline and the evaluation
//! instant the availability rule needs are carried.
//!
//! ## Reading `billing_timing` here is not a second registration
//!
//! Global Constraint 5 of this group says `billingTiming` REQUIRED on every
//! recurring row is **Slice 6's** registered rule, cross-referenced and never
//! re-registered. [`SetupRowShape`] reads the same column and is not that rule:
//! Slice 6 owns *required on a recurring row*, Slice 2 owns *forbidden on a
//! setup row*, and `inst-cs-setup` names the field itself. The two can never
//! disagree, because no row is both a recurring row and a setup row — the
//! `chargeKind` axis separates them, which is why that axis is in the scope key
//! at all.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately absent
//!
//! The precedent is [`crate::domain::rules`]'s own absence section: *a rule
//! that always passes is indistinguishable from a rule that holds*. Each
//! absence below names its owner.
//!
//! **Owned by another slice, cross-referenced here:**
//!
//! - `billingTiming` required on every recurring row — **Slice 6**
//!   (`inst-cs-recurring`).
//! - `billingGranularity` on all usage rows and `tierAggregationWindow` on
//!   tiered / `package` rows — **Slice 3**, already implemented as
//!   [`EVAL_POLICY_MISSING`](crate::domain::rules::EVAL_POLICY_MISSING), which
//!   `inst-cs-usage` cross-references.
//! - The setup row's charge-timing semantics (`inst-cs-setup-timing`) — a
//!   **read-model projection** and therefore G6. This slice validates the row's
//!   shape, never when it is charged.
//!
//! **Owned by the product / SKU registry, which this gear cannot read:**
//!
//! - "parent SKU `meteringUnit` required" and `SKU_NOT_PUBLISHED`
//!   (`inst-cs-usage`); the anchor half of `inst-cs-customfreq` is absent for a
//!   different reason, recorded in [`crate::domain::plan_rules`]'s table.
//!
//! **Stated by the design set with no code in §5 to report it.** These are not
//! deferrals, they are gaps: a rule with no code cannot be reported to a
//! caller, and minting one or stretching a neighbour would put a discriminator
//! on the wire that no consumer can act on and no document defines.
//!
//! | Requirement | Where it is stated | What exists |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | exactly one `one_time` base row per sold market | `inst-cs-onetime` | the **at most one** half is the physical partial `UNIQUE` `uq_pricing_price_scope_key_current`; the **at least one** half has no code |
//! | recurring-only add-ons rejected | `inst-cs-onetime` | no code, and no authored term for "recurring-only add-on" outside the registry |
//! | at least one recurring base row per sold market | `inst-cs-recurring` | no code |
//! | frequency metadata present | `inst-cs-recurring` | no code |
//!
//! [`HYBRID_INCOMPLETE`] is the hybrid step's code and [`USAGE_MARKET_INCOMPLETE`]
//! is D-84's usage-line code; neither is widened to cover the four rows above.
