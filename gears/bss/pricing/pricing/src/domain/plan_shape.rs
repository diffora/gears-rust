//! The **shape of a plan** — the Slice-2 vocabulary
//! (`design/02-plan-definition.md`).
//!
//! Slice 3 owns what one price row costs; this slice owns what the plan around
//! those rows *is*: the billing-cycle matrix and its frequency metadata, the
//! phase graph with its `convertsToPhaseId` chain, the add-on composition
//! rules, the billing descriptor set, and the availability and
//! purchase-quantity window the plan sells in. Nothing here judges anything —
//! the four validators (`CycleShapeValidator`, `CompositionValidator`,
//! `PhaseGraph` rules, `DescriptorSet` rules) register into
//! [`crate::domain::validation`] the way the Slice-3 rules do, and every code
//! they report is declared once in [`crate::domain::plan_rules`].
//!
//! **Every field is public and unvalidated**, for the reason
//! [`crate::domain::price_row`] states: the value is the *subject* a
//! [`ValidationPipeline`](crate::domain::validation::ValidationPipeline) runs
//! over, and a constructor that refused an unpublishable combination would move
//! the rules into the type — where they cannot be enumerated into one aggregate
//! report, which is the whole point of the fail-closed pipeline. A plan is
//! authored incrementally while it is `draft` (`inst-pa-attach`), so this type
//! has to be able to hold a shape nobody has finished yet.
//!
//! ## `evaluated_at` is a field, never a clock read inside a rule
//!
//! [`crate::domain::validation`] states that the same rule set runs **twice** —
//! as a pre-check at submit and again inside the publish commit — and that a
//! rule must therefore be pure with respect to the state it is handed. A rule
//! that read the wall clock would be neither reproducible nor testable, and it
//! would answer differently in the two runs for no authored reason.
//! `AVAILABLE_FROM_IN_PAST` (`inst-cs-availability`) is the one Slice-2 rule
//! that needs a now, so the now is handed to it on
//! [`PlanShape::evaluated_at`].
//!
//! ## `rows` is the candidate set, and `baseline` is the published past
//!
//! [`PlanShape::rows`] is the row set **the publish would produce**, supplied
//! by the caller that holds the plan. No Slice-2 rule filters it by
//! `lifecycle_state`: published-state facts arrive through
//! [`PlanShape::baseline`] instead. A rule that re-derived "which rows count"
//! would be a second answer to a question the publish unit already answered,
//! and the two answers are free to disagree the day the publish unit changes
//! what it feeds in.
//!
//! ## `windows` is the plane the coverage rules range over, and it is
//! deliberately unfiltered
//!
//! [`PlanShape::windows`] carries the plan's window plane grouped per canonical
//! scope key — the input `inst-wc-required`, `inst-wc-perkey`, `inst-fg-detect`
//! and `inst-wc-availability` are evaluated against
//! ([`crate::domain::coverage`]).
//!
//! **It is subject content, not rule configuration**, which is why it is a field
//! here rather than an argument on
//! [`PublishRuleParams`](crate::domain::publish::rules::PublishRuleParams). That
//! type carries the world *outside* the subject a rule compares against — the
//! tenant's default rounding policy, its size caps, its descriptor requirements
//! — and a window set is not outside the subject: a version freezes the
//! intervals (D-99, D-121) and a reviewer approves what will be frozen. So the
//! approval content pin covers it, and
//! [`content_hash`](crate::domain::approval::content_pin::content_hash) hashes
//! it; a pin over less than the change set is a pin a window schedule walks
//! through.
//!
//! **The read behind it is draft-inclusive and filters no window state, and that
//! is the substance rather than an oversight.** The distinction is between
//! *validating a hypothetical* and *asserting a fact*:
//!
//! - The coverage rules and `window_repo`'s overlap check ask "**if** this row
//!   were current on this key, would the interval set be sound?" — over a change
//!   set made of `draft` rows about to publish. Filtering by lifecycle state
//!   there would let two intervals on one key pass by having one of them belong
//!   to a row the filter dropped, which is exactly what
//!   `price_repo::load_scope_keys_for_plan` states as its own reason for
//!   carrying no filter.
//! - `read_model::project_windows` and the activation sweep **assert facts to a
//!   consumer**, and both restrict to
//!   [`PROJECTED_ROW_STATES`](crate::domain::projection::PROJECTED_ROW_STATES)
//!   — the sweep by a subquery, added after it was found flipping a `draft`
//!   row's window and emitting `PriceWindowActivated` for it.
//!
//! A later group narrowing this read to make it match the projection's would be
//! moving it across that line. Which intervals *contribute coverage* is the
//! reader's question and each reader states its own answer:
//! [`KeyWindows::coverage_end`](crate::domain::window::KeyWindows::coverage_end)
//! drops `cancelled`, and [`crate::domain::coverage`] names the state set
//! `inst-wc-required` and `inst-fg-detect` read.
//!
//! ## The `ALL` lists live here, and the parsing does not
//!
//! Each of the four token enums exports an `ALL` const — one member per
//! variant, declaration order — in the shape
//! [`LifecycleState::ALL`](crate::domain::lifecycle::LifecycleState::ALL) uses.
//! The *parsing* stays at the storage boundary, where a column is read; what is
//! exported is the **variant list**, not a parser.
//!
//! `price_repo.rs` argues the opposite for the Slice-3 enums — it hand-writes
//! ten inverse `const` lists beside its own use of `ModelKind::ALL` and
//! `LifecycleState::ALL` — so a reader will notice the disagreement. The reason
//! this side is chosen here is that Slice 2's tokens have **three** consuming
//! call sites ahead of them, not one: the plan-shape repository, the read-model
//! projector and the authoring surface each have to turn a stored token back
//! into a value. Three hand-maintained copies of one enum's variant list is
//! three chances for a variant added later to go missing from a list that
//! still compiles, and the failure mode is a stored row read back as
//! `CorruptRow` — or worse, matched by a stale list that quietly no longer
//! covers the enum. One authority for "what values exist", three call sites
//! that map it.
//!
//! ## One name this module introduces
//!
//! The persisted token for a custom frequency is spelled **`custom_every_n`**
//! here, and **no document fixes it**. §6 decomposes the concept into a
//! `frequency` column plus `custom_interval_n` / `custom_interval_unit`, and
//! the PRD writes it as `customEveryN{Days|Months}(n)` — neither states what
//! the `frequency` column holds when the frequency is the custom one. The
//! spelling follows the `snake_case` convention every other persisted token in
//! this crate uses (`one_time_setup`, `all_subscriptions`, `whole_unit`); it is
//! recorded here because a token invented in code and never written down is
//! one a later document is free to contradict.
