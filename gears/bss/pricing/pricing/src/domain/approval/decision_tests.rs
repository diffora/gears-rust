//! The decision guards, one at a time and then all at once.
//!
//! **Every refusal test first puts the world in the state where the guard it
//! names is what answers.** Five checks share one request, and four of them can
//! fire on a request built carelessly: a self-approval attempt whose reason is
//! missing is answered by whichever check runs first, and a test that asserted
//! `SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN` on such a request would be evidence about the
//! *order* rather than about the rule. So [`valid`] is a request every check
//! passes, and each refusal below moves exactly one thing.
//!
//! The order itself has its own tests, because it is a decision and not an
//! accident — see `a_self_approval_is_answered_before_the_missing_reason_is`.
