//! The approval content pin — `inst-ap-pin` (`design/05-governance.md` §2, step
//! 2a) and the `content_hash` column §6 declares.
//!
//! One function, [`content_hash`], and the whole of the two-person rule's
//! integrity rests on it: submission pins the digest of the content a reviewer
//! is about to look at, and `approve` recomputes it. Equal ⇒ the reviewer
//! approved what they saw. Unequal ⇒ `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH` (409), because
//! something moved between the two moments and the signature would be about a
//! different plan.
//!
//! # Why the encoding is hand-framed rather than JSON
//!
//! The discipline is [`crate::domain::audit::audit_row_hash`]'s, for its
//! reasons: a domain-separation prefix so this gear's pins cannot collide with
//! any other digest the platform computes, and **length-prefixed, NULL-safe**
//! fields so two different field *boundaries* cannot collide. Without the
//! prefixes a shape whose `plan_tier` is `ab` and `invoice_grouping_key` is `c`
//! hashes identically to one whose fields are `a` and `bc` — and a pin that
//! cannot distinguish those is a pin an author can move a character across and
//! still have verify.
//!
//! `sha2` is not used and is not available: dylint DE0708 blocks it. SHA-256
//! comes from the FIPS-validated `aws-lc-rs` provider the platform installs.
//!
//! # The framing primitives are copied from `audit.rs`, deliberately
//!
//! They are eight lines each and they could be shared. They are not, for the
//! reason `audit.rs` gives for not importing the ledger's: these are two
//! **frozen encodings**, and a shared helper puts both behind one edit. A change
//! to `put` that was reasoned about for the audit chain would silently
//! re-key every pending approval in every tenant — the pins would stop matching
//! the content they were taken over and every open unit would answer
//! `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH` for a change nobody made.
//!
//! # The pin's domain is `PlanShape`, and that is a boundary rather than a rule
//!
//! [`content_hash`] takes a [`PlanShape`] and hashes everything in it but two
//! fields. What it therefore cannot hash is anything the plan revision row
//! carries that the shape does not, and **that set is not empty** — it is
//! `row_version`, `created_by`, `created_at_utc` and `lifecycle_state` off
//! `pricing_plan`. The rule is not "everything a `PlanShapePatch` can move plus
//! everything the row carries about itself"; it is *the shape*, and the
//! difference has to be argued rather than left to be read off the destructuring
//! guard, which can only speak for the type it destructures.
//!
//! `sku_id` **was** in that difference and is not any more. It is authored — a
//! `PlanShapePatch` moves it on an open draft — so it is now a field of
//! [`PlanShape`], assembled by `infra::publish::assemble` and hashed here. The
//! reason it could not stay an argument is the approve→commit window: a
//! re-derivation that cannot see a rebind verifies a plan selling one SKU
//! against a pin taken over another, with every digest equal.
//!
//! The four that remain outside, each with the reason it cannot move under a
//! pending unit rather than a reason it does not matter:
//!
//! - **`created_by` and `created_at_utc`** are minted with the revision row and
//!   no path updates them. `revision` *is* hashed, so a different provenance is
//!   a different `(plan_id, revision)`, which is a different pin by
//!   construction.
//! - **`lifecycle_state`** leaves `draft` by exactly two paths, and both are
//!   already accounted for: the publish commit, which is the act the approval
//!   authorizes, and `abandon_draft`, which voids every pending unit of the plan
//!   before it commits.
//! - **`row_version`** moves only when content moves, and every authoring
//!   mutation that moves it voids the unit first (`inst-ap-pin`). Hashing it
//!   would add nothing a content field does not already carry, and would make
//!   the pin depend on how many times a draft had been saved.
//!
//! **What keeps *this* boundary honest is not the compiler.** The `PlanShape`
//! destructuring below fails to compile on a field added to *the shape*; it
//! says nothing about a column added to `pricing_plan`. So the obligation is
//! written down instead: a revision column added by a later slice is either
//! carried onto [`PlanShape`] — where the guard picks it up — or argued into the
//! list above. `sqlite_plan_repo.rs`'s per-table copy tests are the same
//! discipline for the same table.
//!
//! That is the **only** residual, and it was not always: until 2026-08-18 the
//! sentence above was the file's whole account of what the destructures miss,
//! while six nested aggregates inside the shape were reached by dotted field
//! access with no gate at all. See *Every struct is destructured* below.
//!
//! # Two fields of `PlanShape` are deliberately **not** hashed
//!
//! [`PlanShape::evaluated_at`] and [`PlanShape::baseline`], and the first is not
//! a preference:
//!
//! - **`evaluated_at`** is the instant the validation pipeline is being run at,
//!   handed in by the caller (`plan_shape.rs`'s own module doc: it is a field so
//!   that no rule reads a clock). The approve path re-assembles the shape at a
//!   *different* instant by construction. Hashing it would make every
//!   re-verification fail — `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH` on every approve, for
//!   every plan, with nothing having changed — so the pin would be not merely
//!   over-wide but unusable.
//! - **`baseline`** is the plan's *published past*, re-derived on each assembly
//!   from rows this revision does not own. It is not content a reviewer is shown
//!   and not content this revision can author. It also cannot move while a unit
//!   pends: a `submitted` unit holds the plan's scope key through
//!   `PENDING_CHANGE_UNIT_EXISTS`, so no second publish of the same plan can
//!   land and change what the baseline is.
//!
//! Every other field of the shape is hashed, and the **price rows'** own
//! provenance (`created_by`, `created_at_utc`) and `row_version` with them: the
//! rule inside the shape is "everything, minus the two argued above", rather
//! than a hand-picked consumer-visible subset, because a subset is a list
//! somebody has to keep true and the failure mode of getting it wrong is a
//! mutation the guard cannot see. What that rule does **not** reach is the
//! revision row's own four; see the section above.
//!
//! # One field is framed **narrower** than it is stored: the window state
//!
//! [`WindowInterval::state`] has four values and the preimage has two tokens for
//! them — [`PIN_WINDOW_STATE_LIVE`] for `scheduled`, `active` and `expired`, and
//! [`PIN_WINDOW_STATE_CANCELLED`] for `cancelled`. It is the one place this
//! encoder frames something other than the value it was handed, so it is argued
//! here rather than read off [`put_window_interval`].
//!
//! **The three collapsed states are the clock's, and the clock is not an author.**
//! §4's `scheduled → active` (`inst-ws-activate`) and `active → expired`
//! (`inst-ws-expire`) fire on `now` reaching a stored bound; `WindowActivationJob`
//! performs them on a 60-second tick and D-99's paired clarification says in as
//! many words that they are **not publish units** and re-project nothing, *"so
//! the time-driven transitions change nothing projected"*. A digest that moved on
//! one of them would give a clock-driven transition a consequence the design set
//! spent that clause denying it, and the consequence is the worst available:
//! `inst-ws-future-start` (D-63) puts every newly scheduled window's start
//! strictly in the future and `inst-wc-required` refuses a billable row with no
//! window, so **every** pending plan-revision approval has an activation boundary
//! ahead of it. Framing `state` verbatim therefore made an ordinary tick refuse
//! the reviewer's decision with `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH` (409) over content
//! nobody had touched — "the attack the pin exists to catch and is not one", with
//! no remedy at all, because the message asks the author to re-submit and time
//! cannot be put back.
//!
//! **`cancelled` stays distinct, and that is the same argument in the other
//! direction.** A cancellation is *mutation*-driven: it is a publish unit under
//! D-99, always-material under D-62, and a change a reviewer is entitled to see
//! before they sign — so it must move the digest. Dropping the token altogether
//! was rejected for that reason: `window_repo::list_for_plan` returns cancelled
//! windows too (`GET …/coverage` renders them deliberately), so a token-free
//! interval frame would make a cancel invisible to the pin while leaving it
//! visible on the wire.
//!
//! What the narrowing costs, stated because it is the residue: two shapes
//! differing **only** in that one key holds `[a, b)` as `scheduled` where the
//! other holds it as `expired` pin identically. That is a pair no clock can
//! produce out of order — a window reaches `expired` only through `active` — and
//! where it does arise it is the same interval at two moments of its own life,
//! which is precisely what must not move the digest.
//!
//! # Collections are hashed in a canonical order, not the order they arrive in
//!
//! `rows`, `phases`, `addon_rules`, `depends_on`, `conflicts_with`, `bands`,
//! `windows` and each key's `intervals` are sorted on their members' own
//! identities before framing. The repositories already return them in exactly
//! these orders (`price_repo::load_for_plan` by `price_id`,
//! `plan_shape_repo::load_phases` by `(ordinal, phase_id)`, `load_addon_rules`
//! by `addon_sku_id`, the band read by `from_qty`, and
//! `window::group_by_key_seeded` by the key's canonical rendering and then by
//! `(effective_from, effective_to, state)`), so this changes no digest today. It is here for the day one of
//! those `ORDER BY`s changes: without it, a query-plan-visible reordering would
//! fail every pending approval in the fleet with `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH`,
//! which looks exactly like the attack the pin exists to catch and is not one.
//!
//! What it costs, stated because it is the residue: two shapes differing **only**
//! in the authored order of two phases that share an `ordinal` hash identically,
//! and `PhaseGraph::entry` tie-breaks on that order. A shape with a duplicate
//! ordinal is one `PHASE_CHAIN_NONLINEAR` refuses at publish, so it can never be
//! the subject of a pin — but if that rule is ever relaxed, this is the sentence
//! that has to be revisited.
//!
//! # Every struct is **destructured**, and that is the guard
//!
//! No field of any struct this encoder frames is reached through a dot. Each
//! encoder binds its struct with an exhaustive pattern and no `..`, so a field
//! added to `PlanShape`, `PriceRecord`, `PriceRow`, `PlanPhase`, `AddonRule`,
//! `DescriptorSet`, `TierBand`, `IncludedAllowance`, `KeyWindows`,
//! `WindowInterval`, `OverlayRevision`, `OverlayLine`, `MembershipMoveProposal`,
//! `ThresholdEntry`, `GrantSet`, `EntitlementGrants`, `CompositeMeter`,
//! `PlanChangeContract`, `PeriodFloorCap` or `ProrationContract` **fails to
//! compile here** until somebody decides whether the pin covers it. A test
//! cannot give that guarantee: it can only fail for the fields it already knows
//! about, which is the wrong set by definition.
//!
//! It worked: `PlanShape::windows` could not be added without E0027 here, and
//! the decision it forced is recorded on [`CONTENT_PIN_DOMAIN_SEP`].
//!
//! **The last six of those types were reached through a dot until 2026-08-18**,
//! and that is worth recording rather than quietly fixing. The claim above was
//! written about the outer types and stated as though it held for everything —
//! so `EntitlementGrants`, `GrantSet`, `CompositeMeter`, `PlanChangeContract`,
//! `PeriodFloorCap` and `ProrationContract` were each framed field by field with
//! nothing holding the field list to the type's. Every field was in fact framed;
//! what was missing was the gate, and the gate is the whole claim. Review Z3-6
//! proved it in both directions: `pub scratch: bool` on `EntitlementGrants`
//! compiled with **zero** errors from this file, while the same field on
//! `PlanShape` raised E0027 at `put_plan_shape`. Three of the six carry an
//! inline note naming what an unpinned field would cost — a trial capped at
//! 20 000 instead of 20, a plan changeable to `enterprise` instead of
//! `standard`, a $500 period floor nobody approved — so the arming condition sat
//! beside its own consequence.
//!
//! **Two** types this cannot be done for directly, because their fields are
//! private and their constructors are load-bearing. Both are now reached through
//! a `parts()` accessor that destructures the type exhaustively, so a new field
//! is a compile error in the owning module *and* — because the parts struct is
//! destructured here in turn — a decision at the pin:
//!
//! - [`ScopeKey`](crate::domain::scope_key::ScopeKey), whose ten axes are
//!   frozen by the canonical key itself and by ten columns of `pricing_price`,
//!   read through
//!   [`ScopeKeyParts`](crate::domain::scope_key::ScopeKeyParts).
//! - [`ThresholdVersion`](crate::domain::materiality::ThresholdVersion), read
//!   through [`ThresholdVersionParts`]. Its fields are private because its
//!   constructor is what refuses an empty or duplicated entry set, and a public
//!   field set would be that refusal bypassed. It held three fields and three
//!   bare accessor calls until 2026-08-18; a fourth would have been a
//!   version-level fact this encoder silently omitted.
//!
//! [`PhaseGraph`](crate::domain::plan_shape::PhaseGraph) is the third private
//! type and needs no parts struct: this encoder frames exactly one thing off it,
//! `phases()`, and that accessor now destructures `Self`, so a second field stops
//! it compiling where it is declared.
//!
//! # The one residual, and it is not a hole in the encoding
//!
//! The destructures speak only for the types they destructure. What none of them
//! can see is **a column added to `pricing_plan` that never reaches
//! [`PlanShape`]** — the boundary argued at the head of this file. So the
//! obligation is written down instead: a revision column added by a later slice
//! is either carried onto [`PlanShape`], where the guard picks it up, or argued
//! into that list. `sqlite_plan_repo.rs`'s per-table copy tests are the same
//! discipline for the same table.
//!
//! [`ThresholdEntry`]: crate::domain::materiality::ThresholdEntry
//! [`ThresholdBasis`]: crate::domain::materiality::ThresholdBasis
//! [`ThresholdVersionParts`]: crate::domain::materiality::ThresholdVersionParts

/// Versioned domain-separation tag for the approval content pin.

/// space is a shared collision space.
///
/// Bumped **only** on an intentional re-freeze of the encoding — which
/// invalidates every open approval unit in every tenant, so it is a migration
/// and not an edit.
///
/// # `v1` → `v2`: [`PlanShape::windows`] joined the preimage, and that is a
/// re-freeze
///
/// The window plane is subject content — a version freezes the intervals (D-99,
/// D-121) and a reviewer approves what will be frozen — so
/// [`put_plan_shape`]'s exhaustive pattern refused to compile until the pin
/// covered it, and covering it changed the encoding. That is exactly the
/// "intentional re-freeze" this constant reserves a bump for, so it is bumped.
///
/// **What the bump does and does not buy, measured rather than asserted.** It is
/// *not* what keeps an old pin from verifying against a new shape: the framing is
/// length-prefixed and every collection's count precedes its elements, so the
/// two preimages cannot be equal. A `rows` frame opens with a 16-byte-long
/// `price_id` and the `windows` frame opens with an 8-byte count, so the extra
/// field cannot be absorbed into a longer row list either. A `v1` pin therefore
/// already fails against a `v2` shape without the bump. What the bump buys is
/// that the freeze generation is **recorded in the preimage** instead of being
/// re-derived by that argument every time somebody asks which encoding a stored
/// digest was taken under.
///
/// **The consequence in a deployed world, stated because it is vacuous here and
/// will not stay vacuous.** Every pending approval unit in existence fails
/// `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH` (409) after this change — which looks precisely
/// like the attack the pin exists to catch and is not one. What makes it an edit
/// and not a migration today is that **this gear is not deployed**: there is no
/// durable `pricing_approval` row anywhere holding a `v1` digest, so every pin
/// ever taken under `v1` was taken inside a test process that has exited. That
/// is a narrower argument than the one this paragraph carried before — it used
/// to say "no surface opens one (G5 mounts the route)", which stopped being true
/// when phase 3 mounted `POST /plans/{planId}/publish`: that route opens a
/// pending unit today, and `tests/rest_approvals.rs` drives it. **In a deployed
/// world the same change needs a drain of pending approvals first** — every open
/// unit decided or withdrawn before the encoding moves — because a re-freeze
/// under load is indistinguishable at the surface from content having been moved
/// under the reviewer.
///
/// # `v2` → `v3`: the window state is framed as two tokens, not four
///
/// Same day, one review later, and for the defect the `v2` shape carried: framing
/// [`WindowInterval::state`] verbatim let the `WindowActivationJob`'s 60-second
/// tick void a pending two-person approval, because `inst-ws-future-start` puts
/// an activation boundary ahead of **every** pending unit. The module doc argues
/// the narrowing; this records that it re-freezes the encoding, and that the
/// generation moves with it.
///
/// **Why the generation is recorded rather than argued from, which is the one
/// question the `v1` → `v2` note left open.** The construction that a stale digest
/// cannot verify against a re-derivation under a newer encoding is about
/// *collision*, and it survives this change untouched — every field is
/// `PRESENT|len|bytes` or a bare `ABSENT` and every collection's count precedes
/// its elements, so a preimage determines its own field sequence and two equal
/// preimages frame equal content. But the paragraphs above already say that is
/// **not** what the tag buys: what it buys is that the freeze generation sits *in
/// the preimage*, so "which encoding was this stored digest taken under" is read
/// rather than reconstructed. Two encodings sharing one tag is exactly the state
/// that question cannot be answered in, and it is the state `v1` → `v2` was
/// bumped to leave. The prefix argument also does not reach this change: a
/// narrowed token moves bytes in the **middle** of a preimage, not off its end.
///
/// **And the bump costs nothing here, measured rather than assumed.** The digests
/// it invalidates that the narrowing would not have invalidated anyway are
/// effectively none: `inst-wc-required` refuses a publish whose billable key holds
/// no `scheduled`/`active` window, so a shape that reached `submit` at all carries
/// a non-`cancelled` interval, whose token moves from `scheduled` to `live` under
/// this change with or without a new tag. Keeping `v2` would have preserved no
/// pending approval — it would only have left the generation ambiguous. The
/// **deployed-world** paragraph above applies unchanged and for its own reason:
/// this needs a drain of pending approvals before it ships, and it is an edit
/// today only because nothing durable holds a `v2` digest either.
///
/// # `v3` **stands**: the policy subject did not join this preimage
///
/// G6 gave the approval plane a second pinned subject — a
/// [`ThresholdVersion`](crate::domain::materiality::ThresholdVersion), the
/// always-material unit D-10 opens over a threshold-policy PUT — and the tag did
/// **not** move for it, which is a decision rather than an omission.
///
/// A re-freeze is what this constant reserves a bump for, and there was none: no
/// field of [`PlanShape`] changed, [`put_plan_shape`] frames the same bytes in the
/// same order, and `the_encoding_is_frozen`'s golden vector is unmoved. The policy
/// subject is a **separate preimage** under a separate tag
/// ([`THRESHOLD_PIN_DOMAIN_SEP`]) reached through a separate function, because the
/// module doc's rule about two frozen encodings not going behind one helper is the
/// same rule about two frozen encodings not going behind one tag: bumping this to
/// `v4` would have invalidated every pending **plan** approval to record the
/// arrival of a subject none of them are about.
///
/// What the separate tag buys is the property this constant exists for, applied
/// across kinds rather than across generations. `pricing_approval` holds one
/// `content_hash` column for both subjects and
/// `approval_repo::find_approved_for_content` matches on `(subject_ref,
/// content_hash)` — so two digests over different kinds of content share a column,
/// and disjoint domains are what make them unable to be read for each other. The
/// `subject_ref` would have caught it anyway; the tag means it does not have to.
///
/// # `v4`: D-196's usage line joined the key's framing (2026-08-06)
///
/// This **is** the re-freeze the counter is for, and unlike the `v3` case it is not
/// a narrowing of one token: [`put_scope_key`] gained two framed fields, so every

/// window group — produces different bytes. A `v3` digest and a `v4` digest over the
/// same content differ, and the bump is what makes that legible instead of silent.
///
/// The **deployed-world** paragraph applies verbatim, for the reason it applied at
/// `v2 -> v3`: this needs pending approvals drained before it ships, and it is an

/// [`THRESHOLD_PIN_DOMAIN_SEP`] does **not** move with it. A

/// # `v6`: Slice 6's proration contract joined the row's framing (2026-08-07)
///
/// The `v4` case again, and for the same reason it was a bump rather than a

///
/// The **deployed-world** paragraph applies verbatim once more: this needs
/// pending approvals drained before it ships, and it is an edit today only

/// # `v7`: Slice 6's plan-change contract joined the plan's framing (2026-08-07)
///
/// The third re-freeze of this counter and the same case as `v4` and `v6`:

/// # `v8`: the entitlement grant set joined the same framing (2026-08-07)
///
/// `v7`'s case again, one field over, and the consequence is a third kind:

///
/// `v4`'s and `v6`'s case once more: [`put_price_row`] gained two framed fields,
/// so every preimage containing a price row produces different bytes. The pair
/// is authored draft content a `PATCH` moves, and the hole it closes is a
/// **money** one of the most direct kind available on this table — a reviewer
/// who approved a reserved rate of 1 000 minor units and a commit that publishes
/// 100, with every digest equal. `reservation_flavor` travels with it because it
/// decides whether the reserved quantity leaves the on-demand tier counter at

/// flipping it moves the charge without moving the rate.
///
/// **`v6` through `v9` all collapse for anyone deploying**: nothing durable held

/// # `v10`: Slice 10's typed floors and discount hook joined it (2026-08-08)
///
/// `v9`'s case, four fields over and in one group with it. Each closes a
