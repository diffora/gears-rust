//! Everything a decision must satisfy before the store is touched —
//! `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-algo-two-person` (`design/05-governance.md` §3), the pin
//! re-verification of `inst-ap-pin`, and the approver-scope rule
//! `inst-ap-scope`.
//!
//! One entry point, [`authorize_decision`], and it is **pure**: it takes the
//! record's own facts and the request's, and answers with a
//! [`DecisionRefusal`] or nothing. It reads no clock, no database and no claim
//! resolver. That is what lets the whole rule set be a table test rather than a
//! choreography, and it is why the audited-denial writer sits one layer up in
//! [`crate::infra::approval`] — writing a record is not a judgement.
//!
//! # The order of the checks is a decision, and the argument is the audit
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. NotPending      2. SelfApproval      3. OutOfScope
//! 3b. ForeignWithdraw
//! 4. ReasonRequired  5. ContentMismatch
//! ```
//!
//! **`NotPending` first** because it is the operative fact about the record
//! rather than about the request: a caller holding a decided record is told
//! *that*, whatever they asked for. [`ApprovalState::transition`] already
//! resolves its own refusals in that order and this keeps the two agreeing.
//!
//! **`SelfApproval` before `ReasonRequired`**, and this one is load-bearing.
//! `inst-tp-selfaudit` requires the attempt to be **written to the audit log**.
//! A submitter rejecting their own unit with no reason would, under the other
//! order, be answered `REASON_REQUIRED` — a well-formedness complaint that
//! invites them to retry with a reason and lands **no** attempted-violation
//! record. The self-approval attempt would be swallowed by a check about the
//! shape of the request. So the two audited rules come first.
//!
//! **`ContentMismatch` last** because it is the only check whose input the
//! caller cannot see: it needs the subject re-derived from the store. Answering
//! it ahead of the identity rules would tell a principal who may not decide at
//! all that the content moved, which is a fact about a change set they were
//! never entitled to.
//!
//! # What each decision is actually checked for
//!
//! | | `Approve` | `Reject` | `Void` |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `NotPending` | yes | yes | yes |
//! | `SelfApproval` | yes | yes | **no** |
//! | `OutOfScope` | yes | yes | **no** |
//! | `ForeignWithdraw` | no | no | **yes, when a principal withdraws** |
//! | `ReasonRequired` | no | yes | no |
//! | `ContentMismatch` | yes | **no** | **no** |
//!
//! Three of those cells are choices rather than readings, and each is argued:
//!
//! - **`Void` is exempt from the *distinctness* rules and bound by its own.** A
//!   withdraw's decider *is* the submitter (`inst-as-void`: "the submitter (or a
//!   `CatalogAdmin`) explicitly withdraws it"), and the TOCTOU void has no human
//!   decider at all. A distinctness rule applied here would make the withdraw
//!   path — the one §4 added precisely so a pending unit is not an indefinite
//!   lock on a scope key — unreachable by the person it is for. The exemption is
//!   read off [`DecisionBy::approver`] rather than off a decision match: the two
//!   arms that exercise review authority are the two that carry an approver, and
//!   the rules ask for one instead of asking which decision this is.
//!
//!   **That exemption swallowed the other half of `inst-as-void` for as long as
//!   it stood alone.** The instruction names *who* may withdraw, and because
//!   `approver()` is `None` on every void, no rule here read the withdrawer at
//!   all: any principal the gate admitted could close any `submitted` unit and
//!   release the scope keys it held. `ForeignWithdraw` (3b) is that half, and
//!   [`WithdrawAuthority`] records why its second clause is a proxy.
//! - **`Void` is exempt from the pin.** Voiding is what a moved subject *causes*;
//!   refusing to void because the subject moved would leave the record pinned
//!   open by the very event that should close it.
//! - **`Reject` is checked for scope, and §2 step 4a's literal says "approve".**
//!   **Reported as a divergence, not absorbed.** A reject is the same principal
//!   deciding the same pinned change set, and it is not the harmless direction:
//!   `inst-as-reject` returns the plan to `draft`, so an EU-scoped reviewer
//!   rejecting a US repricing unwinds work they were denied the authority to
//!   approve. The guard is widened rather than narrowed, so the failure mode of
//!   being wrong about this is a refusal an operator can see, not a decision
//!   nobody was entitled to make.
//!
//! **`Reject` is *not* checked against the pin, matching §2 step 2a's literal**
//! ("approve re-verifies the pinned content hash"). A reject of content that has
//! since moved refuses a plan revision that no longer exists in that form, and
//! the subject returns to `draft` either way; there is nothing the mismatch
//! would protect.
//!
//! # `region` here is the **pricing** axis, and never the authz-region claim
//!
//! `inst-rb-region` and S4 C5 are explicit: pricing `region` is a commercial
//! axis, deliberately decoupled from the identity provider's region claim. So
//! [`DecisionRequest::approver_regions`] is the approver's grant **expressed in
//! pricing regions**, and the change set's regions come off the pinned rows'
//! scope keys. Conflating the two would let a reviewer whose `IdP` tenant happens
//! to sit in one deployment region approve pricing for another.
//!
//! **What no document fixes, and what this therefore cannot do:** nothing in the
//! design set says how a principal's pricing-region grant is *transported* —
//! which claim, constraint or resource property carries it.
//! `inst-rb-preview-scope` says the preview grant carries an explicit
//! pricing-region set and stops there. So this module takes the set as a
//! parameter and the surface that mounts the route owes the plumbing; the gap is
//! reported rather than closed by minting a property name here.
//!
//! # Brand is **not** checked, and that is not an omission
//!
//! §2 step 4a says "every region/brand touched by the pinned change set". For a
//! `plan_revision` subject there is no brand to touch: brand is not a price-row
//! field (S4 `inst-tx-brand`), and `inst-rb-preview-scope` says in as many words
//! that brand "has **no selector** on the base-price preview surface" and
//! applies only where a brand-scoped artifact — a brand-scoped `PriceOverlay` —
//! is the object. This gear authors no overlays. A brand check here would range
//! over the empty set and read as coverage.
