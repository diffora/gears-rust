//! The migration schedule: its state machine, its scheduling rules and the
//! judgements that gate both (`inst-mst-start`, `inst-mst-complete`,
//! `inst-mst-cancel`, `inst-mst-cancel-inflight`, `inst-mg-target`,
//! `inst-mg-cancel`, `inst-mg-idem`, `inst-mg-boundary`, D-34, D-39, D-49).
//!
//! The catalog **schedules**; Subscriptions **executes**. Everything in this
//! module follows from that split: nothing here mutates a subscription, nothing
//! here touches a posted invoice (M1), and the two non-terminal transitions are
//! driven by calls *from* the executor rather than by this gear's clock.
//!
//! # The wall clock does not move this machine
//!
//! `inst-mst-start` is explicit — the flip to `in_progress` happens when the
//! effective date has passed **and** Subscriptions calls `POST .../start`,
//! "never by the wall clock alone". A schedule whose `effective_at` has passed
//! and whose executor has not called is still `scheduled`, and that is the state
//! the `pricing.migration.stalled` alarm exists to notice. Had the catalog
//! flipped on time alone, D-36's execution-time re-resolution would have run
//! against a party that had not started, and the freshly-resolved exclusion set
//! would have had no delivery path to the party that executes (D-65).
//!
//! # D-34, and why `in_progress -> cancelled` is an edge
//!
//! Confirmed by the product owner 2026-08-07. A partially-executed run can be
//! stopped: further `PlanLink` processing halts, already-migrated subscriptions
//! are unaffected — the catalog never held their state, so "unaffected" is by
//! construction rather than by a compensating write — and the partial sets are
//! listed on the record. **Only a `completed` run is uncancellable**, which is
//! why [`MigrationState::ensure_cancellable`] answers
//! [`DomainError::MigrationCompleted`] and not the pre-D-34
//! `MIGRATION_ALREADY_EFFECTIVE`: that code named "past its effective date",
//! which is true of most runs that can still be stopped.
//!
//! # Cancellation propagates as a state handshake, not a clock
//!
//! `inst-mg-cancel`. Subscriptions MUST re-read the schedule state immediately
//! **before beginning execution** and per processing batch thereafter, so it
//! never starts or continues against a cancelled record. That closes the T-epsilon
//! race a "cancel before the effective date" wall-clock rule leaves open, and it
//! is why cancellation rides the record's own state plus audit rather than a new
//! event name (§7). [`MigrationState::admits_further_processing`] is the
//! predicate that handshake asks, stated once here rather than at each caller.
//!
//! # D-49's notice period is enforced here, and its floor is enforced twice
//!
//! [`NoticePeriod`] carries the tenant's configured lead time. The **60-day
//! floor** is a `CHECK` on `pricing_policy_object` as well as a rule here: a
//! tenant may raise the period and never silently lower it. Validation compares
//! `effective_at` against the **announcement instant** — the scheduling commit —
//! plus the period, because that is the moment a subscriber could first have
//! learned of the change.
