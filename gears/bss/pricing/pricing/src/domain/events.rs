//! The **frozen** event-name set.
//!
//! Frozen means what it says: the names below are the contract, and a consumer
//! subscribing to `PriceWindowActivated` is entitled to keep receiving it under
//! that name forever. Adding a name is a contract change; renaming one is a
//! break, which is why [`CatalogEvent::as_str`] is asserted against literal
//! strings in the tests rather than derived from the variant identifiers — a
//! refactor that renames a variant must not silently rename a wire event.
//!
//! Delivery properties, all normative (`design/01-foundation.md`):
//!
//! - Emitted from a **transactional outbox** — an event exists if and only if
//!   its commit happened.
//! - **Ordered per `(tenantId, aggregateId)`**. Not globally ordered: a global
//!   order would serialize every tenant's publishing behind one sequence, and
//!   no consumer needs cross-aggregate order.
//! - **At-least-once**, carrying correlation and idempotency keys, so a
//!   consumer dedups rather than assuming exactly-once.
//!
//! There is **no deletion event**, and its absence is a design property rather
//! than an omission: published rows are never deleted. A row leaves service by
//! being superseded or by its plan being retired ([`CatalogEvent::PlanRetired`])
//! and stays readable as history — so a consumer never has to reconcile a
//! disappearance.
