//! The proposed member set a **material** membership change carries as its
//! approval payload (`inst-mm-pending`, `design/09-price-overlays.md:215`).
//!
//! Memberships have no draft table (`inst-mm-pending`'s own words: "no
//! `pricing_group_membership` row is written before approval"), so unlike a
//! plan revision, an overlay revision or a threshold-policy version, a material
//! membership change has nothing durable in this crate's other stores for a
//! pending unit to point at. What `inst-mm-pending` settles instead: the
//! proposed member set — per payer, the group and the effective instant they
//! are moving into — travels **inside the approval record itself**, and is
//! read back off the record rather than off a second store.
//!
//! [`MembershipMoveSet`] is that payload. `crate::domain::approval::content_pin`
//! is what pins it (`membership_content_hash`); `crate::infra::approval` is
//! what carries it through `pricing_approval.subject_ref` — the one column of
//! that table with room for it, and the reason a re-derivation needs no store
//! read at all: the content the pin was taken over is the `subject_ref`'s own
//! text, so it cannot have moved between submit and decide the way a plan's
//! rows can.
