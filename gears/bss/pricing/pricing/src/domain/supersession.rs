//! The supersession unit's own domain rules — the ones that are preconditions
//! rather than pipeline rules.
//!
//! The unit's **content** rule lives elsewhere and is a
//! [`ValidationRule`](crate::domain::validation::ValidationRule):
//! [`SupersessionPair`](crate::domain::rules::SupersessionPair) is the D-82/D-98/
//! D-122/D-127/D-129 unit guard, and it belongs in the rule set because it judges
//! a pair of rows and reports violations alongside every other row rule. What is
//! here judges neither rows nor shape — it judges the **changeover instant**, and
//! it is asked twice about the same value at two different moments.
//!
//! # Why the floor is two floors (`inst-su-instant`)
//!
//! The instant MUST be strictly future **at submit** and at least the max
//! batching-delay SLO in the future **at approval commit**. Those are not two
//! spellings of one rule and neither implies the other in the direction that
//! matters:
//!
//! - Holding a **submit** to the commit floor would refuse a unit that is going to
//!   be perfectly legal by the time a second person approves it. A submit is a
//!   proposal; the batching delay has not started running against it.
//! - Holding a **commit** to the submit floor is the money defect the rule exists
//!   for. `CatalogVersion` assignment batches (D-47: p95 ≤ 60s, max 5 min), so an
//!   instant inside that lag activates the successor's window while its row is not
//!   yet addressable at any *completed* version — renewals and arrears fail closed
//!   for up to the whole delay, multiplied across every key of a repricing run.
//!
//! The design set gives the second refusal a remedy rather than a retry: the unit
//! is **recomposed** against a fresh instant. That word is in the message on
//! purpose — a caller told only "422" would resubmit the same instant, which is
//! refused identically and further behind the floor each time.
//!
//! # The delay is a constant here and a knob in `config`, deliberately
//!
//! [`MAX_BATCHING_DELAY`] is 5 minutes, D-47's ratified maximum, and it is **not**
//! read from [`JobsConfig`](crate::config::JobsConfig) even though
//! `catalog_version_overdue_secs` defaults to the same 300 seconds from the same
//! decision. The two are the same number with different natures: that field is an
//! **alarm threshold**, an ops question about how long to wait before shouting, and
//! lowering it costs an operator some noise. This is a **correctness floor**, and
//! lowering it buys a tenant transiently unrateable subscriptions. A floor that a
//! configuration file can move is not a floor.
//!
//! `inst-gc-compose` holds the cutover's changeover to the same bound. When that
//! unit is built it takes this constant, not a copy of the number — a
//! hand-maintained second copy is how the two mechanisms come to disagree about
//! the same SLO.

///    a window schedule, a *revival* rather than a supersession, so the refusal says
///    that instead of inviting a retry.
/// 2. **Would the successor collide?** The successor is open-ended (`[changeover,
///    …)`), so anything on the key beginning at or after the changeover is inside
///    it. That is `WINDOW_OVERLAP`, and compose is the last place it can be a

/// [`crate::domain::instant`], and a second owner of that rule is how the two come
/// to disagree. And it does not look for **pre-existing** interior gaps on the key:
/// the shorten moves one end earlier and the successor fills from exactly that
/// instant, so it can open no new gap, and an old one is `inst-fg-detect`'s at
/// publish. A compose that re-refused it would report a defect this act neither
/// caused nor can fix.
///
