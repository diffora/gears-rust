//! `TaxDisplayValidator` — `inst-td-policy`, `inst-td-basis-uniform` and
//! `inst-td-gagate` of `design/04-currency-tax.md` §3, plus §4's sellability
//! state.
//!
//! §1.7 names it as *"Registered rules: `taxInclusive`/`taxCategory`
//! completeness under the tenant tax-display policy (C4) + the GA gate (C3)"*.
//! All three run over a `PlanShape` in the Foundation pipeline, because every one
//! of them is a property of a plan's **candidate row set** judged against facts
//! the caller resolved.
//!
//! # The two arms of `inst-td-policy` are not one switch, and D-154 is why
//!
//! §3 step 2 reads as a single sentence — two incomplete-basis cases "both
//! governed by the tenant tax-display policy" — and D-154 splits it in as many
//! words:
//!
//! * **`ratePresent = false` under `taxInclusive = true`** stays governed by the
//!   policy. The missing fact is a *rate*, nobody in this gear owns it, and Tax
//!   Engine is pre-GA — so a tenant may legitimately choose to warn.
//! * **an absent effective category** fails **whatever the policy says**.
//!   `taxCategory` is a pinned D-48 v1 descriptor element whose absence S2
//!   `inst-ds-required` and PRD `fr-billing-descriptors` both make a
//!   publish-blocking MUST, *"and a per-tenant display policy may not publish
//!   past a pinned contract element"*.
//!
//! Reading them as one switch is the defect D-154 was written to close: a tenant
//! on `warn` would publish a row whose category no consumer can resolve, and
//! Billing would receive a descriptor set missing one of its five.
//!
//! # The effective category, and why absence has two sources
//!
//! `inst-td-policy` evaluates `coalesce(row.tax_category_ref,
//! readiness.taxCategory)`. Both halves can be absent and they are different
//! facts:
//!
//! * the **region is undeclared** — [`RegionTaxReadiness`] answers `None`, and C4
//!   fails closed on it outright (*"an unknown region fails closed"*);
//! * the region is declared and states **no default**, and the row states none
//!   either — the effective category resolves to nothing.
//!
//! Both block, but only the second is the `TAX_BASIS_INCOMPLETE` D-154 makes
//! unconditional. The first is a region that should not be on a row at all, which
//! `inst-tx-region` refuses first and more precisely — so this module reports it
//! as the category failure it also is, rather than duplicating that rule's
//! refusal.
//!
//! # `inst-td-basis-uniform`'s row set is scoped, and the scoping is load-bearing
//!
//! D-110 requires one `tax_inclusive` per `(currency, region)`, and **D-132
//! excludes `existing_grandfathered` generations**: they are immutable in
//! content, MUST NOT be superseded and never leave `published`, so an unscoped
//! rule made one cutover freeze a market's display basis **permanently** — every
//! later publish failing on a divergent row nobody can fix. Their subscribers
//! read the basis from their own frozen snapshot, so the invoice-coherence
//! argument is unaffected.
//!
//! Every sibling row-set rule of the design set carves them out the same way
//! (`inst-bc-coverage`, `inst-sg-conjunction`, `inst-mp-grandfathered`,
//! `inst-cl-resets`), which is what makes this a set-wide convention rather than
//! a special case.
