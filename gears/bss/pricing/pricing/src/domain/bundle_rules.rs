//! `BundleValidator` — the publish-time composition rules of
//! `design/08-bundles.md` §3: `inst-bb-declared`, `inst-bb-sum`, `inst-bb-own`,
//! `inst-bc-coverage`, `inst-bc-frequency`, `inst-bc-fail`, `inst-bc-taxbasis`
//! and the `inst-rs-*` rules' entry into the same report.
//!
//! Where [`crate::domain::bundle`] is arithmetic over **one** rev-share group,
//! this module is about a whole composition: every component, every sold market,
//! and the cross-component properties that no single row can carry.
//!
//! # The input is a snapshot, and that is what makes these rules pure
//!
//! [`BundleComposition`] holds facts the caller has already resolved — is this
//! component plan published, is it itself a bundle-type plan, does it carry an
//! authored phase schedule, what rows does it have. None of them is derivable
//! here, and all of them are reads. §4.2's contract requires a rule to be **pure
//! with respect to the state it is handed**, because the same rule set runs twice
//! — as a pre-check at submit and again inside the publish-commit transaction,
//! where the world has moved. A validator that fetched its own inputs would be
//! answering two different questions on the two runs.
//!
//! # The coverage set is narrowed before it arrives, deliberately
//!
//! `inst-bc-coverage` evaluates over `priceEligibility = all_subscriptions`
//! (`cohort = none`) rows **only**: grandfathered generations (ADR-0002) are
//! never coverage candidates, and `new_subscriptions_only` rows are not either —
//! bundle composition demands the durable base, and a new-only promo row expires
//! with its intent. That narrowing is the **caller's**, applied when it builds
//! [`ComponentSnapshot::rows`], for the reason above: it is a filter over stored
//! rows, and re-deriving "which rows count" here would be a second answer to a
//! question the read already settled. [`CoverageRow`] carries only what the rules
//! compare, which is what keeps the two from drifting.
//!
//! # Slice 4's debt to this module, and how it was paid
//!
//! `inst-bc-coverage` says the **currency** axis delegates to Slice 4's
//! `CurrencyBindingChecker` (case ii) while the `region` axis is this
//! validator's own extension of the same rule. That checker did not exist when
//! this walk was written, so both axes were checked here and the delegation was
//! reported as owed (D-211).
//!
//! Slice 4 landed it, and the delegation is now made — **to the predicate, not
//! to the walk**, and the distinction is the whole of what D-211 buys. D-95
//! moved case (i) from *currency* to the `(currency, region)` **pair**, so there
//! is no currency axis left to hand over on its own: what the two planes can
//! honestly share is the question *which sold markets is this thing not covering*,
//! which is [`crate::domain::currency_binding::uncovered_pairs`]. The rule stays
//! here — which markets are sold, which rows count, what the violation says —
//! and only the set difference is shared.
//!
//! Sharing it changed an answer rather than merely relocating one:
//! `composition.markets` is a `Vec` off the request body with no deduplication
//! anywhere on the route, so the old `.any()` walk reported a repeated pair once
//! per repetition. A set difference reports it once
//! ([`a_market_named_twice_is_reported_once`](bundle_rules_tests)).
//!
//! # `inst-bc-sellability` is not here
//!
//! The Slice-7 gate evaluating a bundle as the conjunction over its components
//! is a rule about **an instant** — predicates (1)–(5) at `t` — and this module
//! has no clock and no window set. It belongs beside
//! [`crate::domain::sellability`], whose predicates it reuses, and it is called
//! out here so the absence reads as placement rather than omission.
