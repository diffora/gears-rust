//! The `PriceOverlay` vocabulary — scope, lines, magnitudes and the resolution
//! rule (`design/09-price-overlays.md` §6, D-08, D-42, D-67, D-78, D-138).
//!
//! Where [`crate::domain::overlay_rules`] judges a whole candidate against the
//! world, this module is the **shapes** — and several of the design set's rules
//! are enforced here by being unrepresentable rather than checked, which is
//! stronger than a `CHECK` and cheaper than a rule:
//!
//! * **`(scope_class = 'global') = (scope_value = '')`** — [`ScopeSelector`] is a
//!   closed enum whose `Global` arm carries no value and whose other five arms
//!   each carry one. There is no way to build a classless overlay with a value.
//! * **`fixed` is always amount-based (D-138)** — [`Adjustment::Fixed`] carries
//!   an [`AmountSet`] and no `Magnitude`, so a percentage `fixed` line does not
//!   typecheck. This is the one rule the store spends a `CHECK` on that the
//!   domain makes impossible.
//! * **A `targetSku` line names its plan, and a `cohort` line does too** —
//!   [`LineKey`] has four constructors and no public fields, so the two
//!   `CHECK`s that pair those columns with `plan_id` have no representable
//!   counterexample in this crate.
//! * **The magnitude's type is declared, never inferred (D-08)** —
//!   [`Magnitude`] is a sum, so "a percent value and an amount set at once" and
//!   "neither" are both unconstructible.
//!
//! # What is deliberately **not** enforced here
//!
//! **D-67's ranges.** `0 < v <= 10000` on a discount and `v > 0` on a markup are
//! [`overlay_rules`](crate::domain::overlay_rules)' checks and not constructor
//! refusals, and the reason is §5's own wording: the refusal is
//! `ADJUSTMENT_MAGNITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE` **naming the line**. A constructor cannot
//! name a line in an aggregate report, and the aggregate report is what makes an
//! overlay remediable in one pass rather than in as many round trips as it has
//! faults (Foundation §4.2). The store's two `CHECK`s are the backstop; the two
//! guards are in series, so the pure rule is unit-tested directly rather than
//! only through a path the store would have refused anyway.
//!
//! **Evaluation.** `markup` adds, `discount` subtracts and `fixed` replaces
//! (D-138), and none of that arithmetic is here: evaluation is Tariffs'. What
//! this crate owes is the authored shape, the resolution rule
//! [`resolve_line`] publishes, and the precedence and class order the read model
//! carries. In particular **no sort direction is encoded anywhere**, because
//! §F.1 leaves it undecided — see [`crate::domain::overlay_rules`] for the one
//! place that absence bites.
//!
//! # [`resolve_line`] has no consumer in this crate, and that is the design
//!
//! Stated here for the reason [`crate::domain::overlay_rules`]' own "rules this
//! module deliberately does not hold" section exists: that module names
//! `inst-plv-disclosure`'s exclusion half and `inst-plv-member-preview` by id
//! precisely so an **absent** arm does not read as an oversight.
//! [`resolve_line`] is the mirror image and had no such note — a
//! **present** function, documented "normative and adopted by Rating step 4",
//! with fifteen assertions across four cases, that nothing in this gear calls.
//!
//! Nothing should. The catalog's job on this plane is to **publish the whole
//! line set**: `infra::read_model` freezes every line of the overlay index into
//! the version a consumer pins, and resolution — which line applies to which
//! priced row — happens where the row and its class and generation are known,
//! which is Tariffs' step 4 and not here. There is no resolution route, no
//! in-process resolve method and no consumer gear in this tree;
//! `infra::read_model` contains no `resolve_line`, no `most_specific` and no
//! `lines`.
//!
//! So [`resolve_line`] exists as the **executable statement of a joint
//! contract**: D-78's eligibility filter and D-42's most-specific-wins ranking,
//! written once, in the gear that owns the vocabulary, so the adopting side
//! adopts an implementation rather than a paragraph. Its two helpers,
//! [`LineKey::eligible_for`] and [`LineKey::specificity`], have exactly one
//! caller each and it is this function. **The consequence for whoever adopts it
//! is worth saying plainly**: it has never run against a stored overlay in this
//! crate, so it is a specification that compiles and is unit-tested, not a path
//! this gear exercises in production. Do not delete it — the design set calls it
//! normative — and do not read its presence as enforcement.
