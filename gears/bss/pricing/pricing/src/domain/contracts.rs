//! Slice 6's consumer contracts: the fields a downstream system computes from
//! (`design/06-consumer-contracts.md`).
//!
//! The catalog publishes **inputs**; the math and the enforcement live
//! downstream. Every rule here is therefore a presence/consistency statement
//! about what a publish freezes, never a computation over it — `inst-rc-nocompute`
//! is the slice's own name for that boundary and it is why no rule in this
//! module reads an amount.
//!
//! # Why the subject is the [`PlanShape`] and not a [`PriceRow`]
//!
//! Slice 3's row rules judge a [`PriceRow`](crate::domain::price_row::PriceRow),
//! which deliberately carries no identity and none of the columns this slice
//! owns: `billing_timing` is a column of the
//! [`PriceRecord`](crate::domain::price_record::PriceRecord) that wraps a row,
//! not of the row. A rule here could not read its own field from Slice 3's
//! subject, so the subject is the plan and each rule walks `shape.rows`.
//!
//! That is also what the market-uniformity rule needs (`inst-pi-uniform`): a
//! statement about a *set* of rows crossed with a set of markets has no
//! row-local form at all.

///
/// # What this rule does **not** check
///
/// The referential half — that each feature, quota or `PlanTier` policy is
/// **defined in the registry** (`inst-gs-referential`, `GRANT_REF_UNDEFINED`) —
/// is absent, and it is absent for `PLANTIER_DIVERGENT`'s reason rather than by
/// oversight: this gear **has no registry client at all**
/// ([`crate::domain::ports`] holds the `CatalogVersion` registry and nothing
/// else), so the rule has no world to check against. Registering it over an
/// empty lookup would either refuse every grant set ever authored or pass every
/// one — and a rule that always passes is indistinguishable from a rule that
/// holds. Named here rather than written, exactly as
/// [`plan_rules`](crate::domain::plan_rules) names `SKU_NOT_PUBLISHED` and the
/// divergence half of `PLANTIER_MISSING`.
///
/// **`inst-gs-drift` is absent for the same reason, one layer out.** D-27 has
/// the catalog consume the registry's *tier-policy-change signal* and flag every
/// affected published plan `grants_divergent` in `pricing_operator_flag` (D-85),
/// with the `pricing.contracts.grants_divergent` alarm beside it. The store
/// exists — `m20260802_000007` created it — and the **signal does not**: there is
/// no registry client to receive it and no inbound seam that could carry it. A
/// flag written on no signal would be an operator remediation prompt for a drift
/// nobody detected, which is worse than the gap, and D-85 is explicit that the
/// flag must never ride the versioned read model instead. Named here so the
/// slice that lands the registry seam lands this with it.
