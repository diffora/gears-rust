//! The authored **price row** — the Slice-3-owned shape
//! (`design/03-price-structure.md`).
//!
//! This is what an operator authors and what the Slice-3 rules judge: the
//! explicit `modelKind`, the per-kind money placement, the tier bands under the
//! `[fromQty, toQty)` convention, the package block fields, and the usage
//! evaluation policy (`billingGranularity`, `tierAggregationWindow`, the D-44
//! level-aggregation triple). The `chargeKind` rides along from the canonical
//! scope key because half the shape rules are a function of it.
//!
//! **Per-kind optionality is modelled honestly.** Nearly every field is an
//! `Option`, and none of them is defaulted here. A price row is *authored*
//! before it is *published*, so the type has to be able to hold a draft that is
//! not yet publishable — the rules in [`crate::domain::rules`] are what make a
//! field required for a kind, and a type that made `amount_minor` mandatory
//! would have made `AMOUNT_PLACEMENT_INVALID` unreachable for the one kind it
//! exists to catch.
//!
//! **This type computes no charge.** It carries structure; Tariffs evaluates it.
//!
//! ## Structural compatibility with the conformance corpus
//!
//! The corpus (`bss_fixtures::model::Snapshot`) is the shape the joint golden
//! fixtures freeze, and the publish validator compares against it. This type is
//! deliberately field-for-field compatible with it — same names, same meaning —
//! but it is a **separate type**: the corpus model sits behind the crate's
//! `corpus` feature, which a gear does not enable (the production surface is
//! `ModelKind` + `Registry`), and the corpus `Snapshot` additionally carries
//! `currency`, `proration_basis` and the Slice-10 reservation fields that are
//! not Slice-3-owned.
//!
//! [`ModelKind`] itself is **reused** from `bss_fixtures` rather than mirrored.
//! One vocabulary for the kind enum means the fixture gate's lookup is total by
//! construction, and a sixth kind cannot appear on one side only.

/// ## One list, because two guards ask the same question
///
/// The tier counter `Q` is keyed `(subscription, meter, dimensionKey, window)`
/// and belongs to the subscription's usage history rather than to any row. Two
/// mechanisms hand a subscriber from one row to another **without** resetting
/// it, and each has its own rule saying the denomination must not move across
/// the handover:
///
/// - **supersession** ([`SupersessionPair::mismatched_unit_fields`](crate::domain::rules::supersession::SupersessionPair::mismatched_unit_fields),
///   `inst-tb-supersession-units`), which adds `meter`, `dimensionKey` and the
///   `carry`-conditioned `included_allowance` to this list;
/// - **phase conversion**
///   ([`PhaseOverrideUnits`](crate::domain::plan_rules::phase_graph::PhaseOverrideUnits),
///   `inst-ph-override-units`, D-89), where a `per_hour` trial row converting
///   into a `per_day` evergreen row applies an hours-denominated `Q` to
///   day-denominated bands.
///
/// Both are the D-77 factor-of-24 class arriving through a different door, so
/// the list is written **once**. Two hand-maintained copies is exactly how that
/// class re-enters: the D-127 lesson is that a guard must not be able to differ
/// by which mechanism asked, and a list that can drift is a guard that differs.
///
/// The comparison is **symmetric** — it answers *which fields moved*, not which
/// way — so a caller passes its two rows in whatever order reads chronologically
/// at the call site.
///
/// `aggregationFunction`, `aggregationGranularity` and `tierQualificationWindow`
/// are read through the `effective_*` accessors and never through the raw
/// `Option`s: "authored nothing" and "authored the default" are the same row,
/// and comparing the `Option`s would report a change on a pair that changed
