//! The sellability gate's surface: four of six predicates, answered per
//! canonical scope key from one pinned plan-subject delta (§3 `inst-sg-*`,
//! `dod-sellability`).
//!
//! # It publishes intervals, states and a derived coverage end — never a
//! point-in-time boolean
//!
//! Said once, here, because it is the constraint the whole module is shaped by
//! (D-99, `inst-sg-surface`, Foundation §4.4). Nothing this module produces is a
//! boolean about a moment: [`KeySellability`] carries the key's frozen intervals
//! and its [`CoverageEnd`], and *"is it sellable"* is a
//! [`PlanMarketVerdict`] computed **at** an `at` the caller supplies.
//!
//! A stored boolean would be an INSERT-only answer to a question about the
//! reader's clock, on a store whose contract is that a completed version never
//! changes — and it would make every activation and expiry owe a re-projection,
//! which is exactly what `inst-ws-publishunit` exempts them from.
//!
//! **The guard here is the type, and this is where that is said rather than
//! manufactured into a test.** No field of [`KeySellability`],
//! [`SellabilitySurface`], [`PredicateAnswer`] or [`PlanMarketVerdict`] is a
//! `bool`, and no test can assert that: a test reads values and the property is
//! about the declarations, so the compiler is what holds it. What the suite asserts
//! is the two things a test *can* reach — the vocabulary those types render into
//! (`every_answer_is_one_of_the_three_tokens`) and the absence of a boolean
//! anywhere in the rendered document, at any depth and under any spelling
//! (`the_document_carries_intervals_and_a_coverage_end_and_no_boolean_anywhere`,
//! in `tests/rest_windows.rs`). The wire is where the type guard could still be
//! lost, because a renderer can mint a field the domain never declared.
//!
//! # "Active at `t`" is derived from the interval, never read off the state token
//!
//! [`PlanSubjectDelta::windows`](crate::domain::projection::PlanSubjectDelta::windows)
//! states the rule and this module is its first consumer, so the argument is
//! worth repeating in the place that codes against it: the token is **stale by
//! construction** for every window the activation sweep ever flips, because D-99
//! makes an activation re-project nothing. Predicate (1) reading the token would
//! therefore make an activation owe a re-projection — contradicting the decision
//! that makes the window plane cheap — and until one arrived the key would read
//! unsellable forever behind a token frozen at `scheduled`.
//!
//! **This is a divergence with the design set, reported and not reconciled
//! here.** `inst-sg-surface` spells predicate (1) as *"an **active** window
//! covers `t` … scheduled-only is NOT sellable"*, while D-99 makes active-at-`t`
//! a read-time derivation from frozen intervals; nothing in the set reconciles
//! the two, and no register entry has been minted for it. The settled reading is
//! implemented — derive from `interval ∧ at`.
//!
//! **The two readings part on every input where some interval covers `at` and
//! none of the covering ones is `active`-tokened — a class, not a case.** They
//! agree on the one `inst-sg-surface`'s sentence names: a scheduled-only key is one
//! whose interval has not *started*, and it fails the derived predicate too. But
//! [`KeyWindows::covers_at`](crate::domain::window::KeyWindows::covers_at)
//! consults no token except `cancelled`, so the readings part wherever the
//! intervals covering `at` carry only the other two:
//!
//! - **`scheduled`, not yet swept** — the interval already covers `at` and the
//!   token is frozen behind an activation D-99 makes re-project nothing. The
//!   literal reading answers *not sellable* and would go on doing so forever,
//!   since nothing will ever re-project it.
//!   `a_window_the_sweep_has_not_flipped_is_active_from_its_interval_not_its_token`
//!   is that input.
//! - **`expired`, in the past** — an `at` inside an interval that has since ended.
//!   The literal reading finds no *active* window and refuses; this one answers
//!   off the interval that was effective at that instant. That is the whole
//!   **historical-query class**, which is what D-121 keeps `expired` in the delta
//!   *for*: a frozen version has to answer a past order instant the same way
//!   forever, and folding the token in would make the answer depend on when it was
//!   asked. `a_past_instant_inside_an_expired_interval_still_answers_covered` and
//!   `an_expired_only_key_answers_a_past_instant_off_both_halves` are that input,
//!   the second of them with no `active` token anywhere in the world.
//!
//! Until 2026-08-05 this paragraph said the readings disagreed on **exactly one**
//! input, the first of those two. That was false, and false in the direction that
//! matters: it understated a class to a case, and the class it hid is the one a
//! pinned consumer replaying a past order instant lives in.
//!
//! **The horizon half diverges on the same axis and is no better worded.** §3
//! spells it over the key's "**active-plus-scheduled** coverage", while
//! [`KeyWindows::coverage_end`](crate::domain::window::KeyWindows::coverage_end)
//! filters `cancelled` and nothing else — exactly as `covers_at` does — so
//! `expired` contributes to it too. A key whose intervals are all expired reads
//! [`CoverageEnd::Ends`] where §3 read literally reads [`CoverageEnd::Uncovered`],
//! and the two halves of predicate (1) therefore diverge **together** rather than
//! one of them alone. The derived reading is right on both halves, for the
//! argument above.
//!
//! # Four of six, and the two that are not this gear's are named
//!
//! `inst-sg-pinned` (D-167 clause 3) is the authoritative split and the handoff's
//! *"three sellability predicates"* is loose: **(2)** committed-`CatalogVersion`
//! addressability, **(3)** `availableFrom`/`availableTo` and **(4)** the plan
//! lifecycle state are the three a pre-Slice-7 version already answers, and
//! **(1)** the active-window-plus-horizon predicate becomes answerable here.
//! That is four. The remaining two are [`PredicateAnswer::NotEvaluable`] with the
//! slice that owes each: **(5)** Slice 4's per-market GA-gate flags and Slice
//! 10's prepaid-execution gate, **(6)** D-46's registry `sellable` flag and
//! therefore the products registry gear, which is not in this repository.
//!
//! A consumer must be able to tell *"this predicate is false"* from *"this
//! version cannot evaluate this predicate"*, which is the whole of D-167 clause
//! (3) — so the two are different arms of one answer type rather than one arm
//! with a nullable detail.
//!
//! # Where each predicate's answer lives, and why that is not a weakening of
//! D-94
//!
//! (1) and (5) are **per key** — (1) reads the key's own windows, and §3 says (5)
//! is "evaluated **per scope key / market**, not per plan". (2), (3), (4) and (6)
//! are **plan-level**: (2) is a property of the version the answer was read from,
//! (3) and (4) read plan-subject fields, and (6) applies to the offered SKU.
//!
//! `inst-sg-conjunction` says every bound key "passes predicates (1)–(5)", and
//! the conjunction this module computes is
//! `plan answers ∧ ⋀ over keys (that key's answers)` — identical to
//! `⋀ over keys (plan answers ∧ that key's answers)` for a plan-scoped fact,
//! since the value is the same for every key. Publishing a plan-scoped answer
//! once instead of once per key is therefore a rendering choice and not a
//! narrowing, and it removes the one thing a per-key copy could do: disagree with
//! itself.
//!
//! # Two instructions this gear cannot break, recorded rather than tested
//!
//! - **`inst-sg-joint`** — the gate is a joint rule: the catalog *publishes* the
//!   surface and **Subscriptions enforces at order time**. Nothing here can
//!   create a subscription, so there is no refusal for this gear to get wrong.
//! - **`inst-sg-renewal`** — a renewal is never gate-checked. This surface
//!   answers about a **purchase**: it takes an `at` and a market and returns
//!   whether a *new* subscription may be created, and it carries nothing a caller
//!   could mistake for a renewal decision — no subscription id, no in-flight
//!   state, no entitlement.
//!
//! Manufacturing a test for a rule this gear cannot break would assert the absence
//! of a feature. What *is* asserted is the half that is ours, and on **both** sides
//! of it: the surface's **inputs** are a delta, an instant and a market and that is
//! the whole of them (`the_surface_takes_no_payer_and_holds_no_cache`), and what it
//! **carries** is pinned as the rendered document's whole member set, by equality
//! and at every depth, so a subscription id or an entitlement reaching the wire
//! reddens (`the_document_carries_no_member_a_caller_could_read_as_a_renewal_check`
//! in `tests/rest_windows.rs`).
//!
//! Until 2026-08-05 only the input side was held, and the sentence above about what
//! the surface carries rested on inspection — true by inspection, and unasserted.
//!
//! # Payer independence is the type, and the cache ban is an absence
//!
//! `inst-sg-segment-boundary`: all six predicates are **payer-independent** — the
//! gate does not check group membership, and a plan whose pricing targets a
//! customer group as a separate `planId` is operator-only at launch (RBAC is that
//! gate, not this one).
//!
//! `inst-sg-eligibility-gated` (p2, F-88) adds one obligation this phase carries,
//! and it is negative: **no global sellability cache keyed by plan alone**,
//! because the seventh predicate is the first payer-dependent one and a
//! payer-agnostic cache would have to be torn out to land it. There is no cache
//! here at all, so this is a **type-and-absence** guard rather than a rule with a
//! runtime test: [`SellabilitySurface::of_delta`] takes a delta, an instant and a
//! market, and no payer and no cache handle can be passed to it. The test that
//! holds it asserts the constructor's inputs, which is the only thing a test can
//! assert about an absence.
//!
//! # `inst-sg-bundle` is not evaluated, and the surface exposes no component key
//! set
//!
//! There is no bundle store, no `bundle`-type plan and no component key set to
//! freeze; Slice 8 owns the composition rules. A component walk over an empty set
//! would answer every bundle sellable, which is the one direction a fail-closed
//! gate must not round in — so the walk is absent rather than vacuous.
