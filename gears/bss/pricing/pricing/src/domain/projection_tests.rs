//! What the payload promises, asserted against literals rather than against

//!
//! The wire keys are the whole contract here: a delta is written once, frozen,

//! silently renamed a persisted key would be invisible to every test that
//! reached the payload through the field it renamed — which is the reason
//! `CatalogEvent::as_str` is pinned against literals one module over, and the
//! reason every key below is spelled out.
