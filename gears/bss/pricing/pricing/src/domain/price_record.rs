//! A price row as the store holds it: the authored shape, the canonical scope
//! key it is filed under, and the metadata that is neither.
//!
//! [`PriceRow`] is the **shape** the thirteen Slice-3 rules judge, and it
//! deliberately carries no identity and no key — a rule able to see which row it
//! was looking at would be free to reach a different verdict for two rows that
//! are the same shape. [`ScopeKey`] carries the ten axes. Neither is enough on
//! its own for a caller that has to name a row, tag it, or decide whether it may
//! still be edited, so this module composes them with exactly the columns that
//! answer those three questions.
//!
//! `billing_timing` stays a `String`. `02-plan-definition.md`
//! `inst-cs-recurring` says it in as many words — the requirement is **Slice
//! 6's registered rule**, cross-referenced elsewhere and never re-registered —
//! so an enum minted here would be a second registration of a rule this slice
//! does not own, free to disagree with the one that does.

///
/// - **`charge_kind` comes from the key.** The row's own copy is not stored: the axis
///   is the canonical scope key's and the field on [`PriceRow`] is a convenience the
///   shape rules read. So a record read back always agrees with its own key, and a
///   caller that handed the two different answers gets the key's.
/// - **The bands are sorted by `from_qty`.** A read answers in that order — the table
///   carries no ordinal — so a create that kept the authored order would hand the
///   caller a record that stops equalling itself after one round trip.
///
/// # Why this had to become shared, and what it cost while it was not
///
/// Both rewrites are invisible from the wire, and `api::rest::prices::content_of`
/// fills `charge_kind` with a **placeholder** (`ChargeKind::Recurring`) because
/// `PriceContentView` has no such field. Two consequences followed, both found by
/// review on 2026-08-06 and both Critical:
///
/// 1. `domain::rules::SupersessionUnitGuard` gates on `successor.is_usage()`. Handed
///    the un-normalized row, it saw `Recurring` on every supersession — so on a
///    **usage** key the D-82/D-98/D-122/D-127/D-129 guard returned without evaluating,
///    and a successor could move `meter`, `billing_granularity` or `model_kind` under a
///    continued tier counter. The guard was live, correct, and unreachable through the
///    one surface that has it.
/// 2. `infra::supersession`'s divergent-successor guard compares the request's content
///    against the **stored** successor's. Un-normalized, the two differ in
///    `charge_kind` on every non-recurring key and in band order on any body that
///    lists bands out of order — so a legitimately approved unit was refused
///    `DUPLICATE_SCOPE_KEY` on its committing call, permanently, with a remedy sentence
///    the caller could not act on.
///
/// One spelling, six callers, and the rule is: **anything that judges or compares a
/// row the store will hold must pass it through here first.**
///
/// # Why it lives in the domain and is re-exported from the repository
///
/// It was written in `price_repo` and every caller still spells it
/// `price_repo::authored_content`, which is kept working by a re-export rather than
/// by a rename. It moved here because D-312's bulk-import arm needs it and
/// `domain::import` holds Phase 1's **store-free** rules — a domain module may not
/// reach into `infra`, and the alternative was a second copy of the projection,
/// which is the exact fault the two Criticals above were.
