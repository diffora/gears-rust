//! `TaxonomyValidator` — the three `inst-tx-*` rules of
//! `design/04-currency-tax.md` §3, plus the vocabulary the four tenant
//! taxonomies are addressed by.
//!
//! §1.7 names one entity for all of it: *"Registered rules: `region` membership
//! on price rows; overlay **scope-value** membership per class — `brand`,
//! `region`, `partner`, `orgTier` against their tenant taxonomies (D-120; rule
//! shared with Slice 9, which owns the `customerGroup` analogue)"*. The second
//! half of that sentence is **already built**, in
//! [`overlay_rules::check_scope`](crate::domain::overlay_rules), because Slice 9
//! could not validate an overlay scope without it and the four tables were
//! carried onto its chain to make that possible. What was missing is everything
//! else: the price-row half, the retire guard, and any surface at all through
//! which a value reaches one of the four tables.
//!
//! # Why this module does not re-declare a scope class
//!
//! [`ScopeClass`] already enumerates the six overlay scope classes, ranks them
//! for `inst-plv-class-tiebreak`, and maps the four taxonomy-backed ones to their
//! physical table. A second enumeration here would be a second answer to *which
//! table declares this class's values*, and the two would drift the day a class
//! is added. [`TaxonomyClass`] is therefore a **narrowing** of it — the four
//! classes §5's route can address — and it converts into `ScopeClass` rather than
//! restating its table map.
//!
//! The narrowing is the route's, not an opinion: `global` has no value universe
//! at all, and `customerGroup`'s universe is `pricing_customer_group_taxonomy`,
//! which belongs to Slice 9's membership half and does not exist (D-223 refuses
//! that class outright for exactly this reason). A `PUT` addressing either would
//! be a write to a table this gear does not have.
//!
//! # The refusal codes, and the one this module deliberately does not raise
//!
//! §5 declares `REGION_UNKNOWN` and `TAXONOMY_VALUE_IN_USE`, and both are minted
//! here. It used to declare `BRAND_UNKNOWN`, `PARTNER_UNKNOWN` and
//! `ORG_TIER_UNKNOWN` beside them; **D-239 struck the trio**, and the paragraph
//! below is kept as the record of why, because the shape it describes is one this
//! design set produces repeatedly.
//!
//! [`REGION_UNKNOWN`] is the **price-row** refusal and is genuinely this
//! module's: a row's `region` is a scope-key axis, §2's flow declares the code
//! against that flow, and the remedy is to fix the row. [`TAXONOMY_VALUE_IN_USE`]
//! is the retire guard's and has one owner by construction.
//!
//! The trio was **never raised anywhere in this crate**, and that was a recorded
//! finding rather than an omission. It named the overlay scope-value failure,
//! which `overlay_rules` already reports as `SCOPE_VALUE_UNKNOWN` — declared for
//! the same refusal by D-222 three days before this slice was built, in
//! `design/09-price-overlays.md` §5. Raising both would have made a consumer match
//! on whichever surface happened to answer; raising the trio *instead* would have
//! re-spelled a code Slice 9 shipped. And the trio was three codes for **four**
//! classes: a region-scoped overlay value, which D-120 explicitly brought under
//! the same rule, had a code in neither list.
//!
//! **D-239 split them by surface rather than by class**, which is why this module
//! keeps `REGION_UNKNOWN` and gains nothing: a *price row* naming an undeclared
//! region is a different fact from an *overlay scope* naming an undeclared value —
//! the first is a scope-key axis whose remedy is to fix the row, the second has one
//! remedy for all four classes, and the class rides the violation's subject.

/// Every price row's rounding reference is one the tenant declared (D-321).

/// # The vocabulary is the tenant's, and that is the whole design
///
/// This gear persists a rounding reference and neither defines nor applies the
/// policy (PRD §15), so it cannot say whether `half_up_2dp` is a sensible
/// rounding rule — and D-320 refused to invent a list. What it *can* say is that
/// a reference names nothing the tenant ever declared, which is
/// [`RegionsDeclared`]'s argument on a different axis.
///
/// The hazard is measured rather than imagined. On the stand the day this
/// landed, one plan's seven rows carried `half_up` while the tenant default
/// carried `half_up_2dp`; both published, both resolved, and the two spellings
/// of one intention were invisible to everything.
///
/// # An empty set means **unconstrained**, and that is the opposite of
/// [`RegionsDeclared`]
///
/// A tenant with no declared regions fails every row, because `region` is a
/// scope-key axis every row carries and C2 requires it to be declared. A tenant
/// with no declared rounding vocabulary is simply a tenant that has not opted
/// in: refusing there would break every catalog on the day the taxonomy landed,
/// for a vocabulary nobody had been given a chance to write. Declaring the first
/// value is what turns the check on, and the asymmetry is stated here because
/// the two rules otherwise read alike.
///
/// # One violation per undeclared **value**
///
/// [`RegionsDeclared`]'s reason, and the same arithmetic: forty rows sharing one
/// bad reference are one authoring mistake, and forty copies of it is a report
/// nobody reads to the end.
