//!
//! Every case is driven from **fixed** instants rather than `Utc::now()`, and the
//! reason is the one D-194's case records one plane over: a rule about the distance
//! between two instants, tested against a clock that moves, passes or fails by how
//! long the test took. `now` is a parameter here precisely so it can be a fact.
//!
//! The compose cases below carry more assertions than their line count suggests in
//! one place: the **adjacency** case reconstructs the shortened predecessor and asks
//! `covers` of both intervals on either side of the changeover. Asserting only the
//! two instants — that the end equals the successor's start — would pass equally
//! under an inclusive end, which is exactly the false positive §9 names and would
//! double-cover the changeover instant.
