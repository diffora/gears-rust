//! `CoverageChecker` — the publish-time coverage rules of
//! `design/07-pricewindow-linkage.md` §3: `inst-wc-required`, `inst-wc-perkey`,
//! `inst-fg-detect` and `inst-wc-availability`, and the three §5 codes they
//! raise.
//!
//! Where [`crate::domain::window`] is about **one** window — its state machine,
//! its interval, the four refusals a single mutation can provoke — this module is
//! about a **key's whole window set** and about the plan those keys belong to.
//! That is the plane §5's remaining window codes live on, and that module's own
//! doc says so and names this one as their owner.
//!
//! # There is no second `KeyCoverage`, and that is deliberate
//!
//! The phase plan sketches a `KeyCoverage` carrying "the key, its ordered
//! intervals, its derived coverage end" with a `coverage_end()` and a `covers()`
//! of its own. **That type already exists**:
//! [`KeyWindows`](crate::domain::window::KeyWindows), built by G1, with
//! [`KeyWindows::coverage_end`](crate::domain::window::KeyWindows::coverage_end)
//! answering in a three-armed [`CoverageEnd`] and a writer already in the
//! projector. So [`KeyCoverage`] here is a *report entry* wrapped around one of
//! those and **every arithmetic answer it gives is a delegation**: the coverage
//! end is `KeyWindows`', and containment is
//! [`WindowInterval::covers`](crate::domain::window::WindowInterval::covers) —
//! the crate's single implementation of half-openness, which is what makes
//! adjacency legal in exactly one place.
//!
//! Two carriers of "when does this key's coverage end" would be free to
//! disagree, and one of them is already frozen into a projected payload
//! (D-121/D-167). The plan's sketch is followed in name and not in duplication;
//! the divergence is recorded here rather than left to be noticed.
//!
//! # "Billable" is exact, and today its overlay half is a no-op
//!
//! `inst-wc-required` binds *"every billable row's canonical scope key (resolved
//! on the base `priceOverlay`)"*. In this module that reads:
//!
//! - **a published-candidate row.** [`PlanShape::rows`] is already exactly that
//!   set — `infra::publish::assemble` builds it from `CANDIDATE_ROW_STATES` — so
//!   nothing here re-filters by `lifecycle_state`. `plan_shape.rs`'s own module
//!   doc gives the reason: a rule that re-derived "which rows count" is a second
//!   answer to a question the publish unit already answered, and the two are free
//!   to disagree the day the publish unit changes what it feeds in.
//! - **on the base overlay.** [`ScopeKey::new`] hard-codes
//!   `price_overlay: PriceOverlay::Base`, so no other value is *constructible*
//!   today and [`is_billable`]'s overlay test cannot be false. It is written
//!   anyway, for the reason `content_pin_tests.rs` gives for framing the same
//!   axis: the day Slice 9 adds an overlay, the rule already sees it.
//!
//! **What Slice 9 then owes, said loudly because the filter alone would hide
//! it.** An overlay row's key *resolves onto* the base overlay — that is what
//! `inst-wc-required`'s parenthesis means. So the day a non-base row exists, this
//! rule must **resolve** it onto its base key and check *that* key's coverage.
//! Merely skipping it, which is what the filter below does, would let an overlay
//! row publish with no coverage requirement at all — a discount plane selling
//! into a void. The filter is correct while non-base rows do not exist and is a
//! defect the moment they do.
//!
//! # Every charge kind is billable, per `inst-wc-perkey`
//!
//! No `ChargeKind` is excluded. `inst-wc-perkey` names the opposite obligation —
//! a hybrid's `recurring`, `usage` and `one_time_setup` components each carry
//! their **own** coverage, because each is its own canonical scope key (the
//! `chargeKind` axis exists precisely so they do not collide). Covering the
//! recurring key covers nothing else.
