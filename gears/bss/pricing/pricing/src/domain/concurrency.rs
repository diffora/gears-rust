//! Optimistic concurrency: the row version, and the entity tag a caller submits
//! it back as.
//!
//! `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-fr-concurrent-edit` (`design/01-foundation.md` §1.2)
//! forbids one outcome above every other: a bulk import and an interactive edit
//! both writing the same draft, the loser's change gone and nobody told. The
//! guard is a version the caller must have **read** before it may write — a
//! submit carrying a version that is no longer current is refused as
//! `STALE_VERSION` (409, §3.3) instead of applied.
//!
//! The type lives in the **domain** even though `ETag` and `If-Match` are HTTP
//! spellings. Optimistic concurrency is a Foundation rule rather than a
//! transport convenience: the repositories and the REST layer have to agree, to
//! the byte, on what tag denotes what version. Were the rendering left to the
//! REST layer it would be re-derived there — a second definition of a valid tag,
//! free to drift from the one that parses tags back, and a drift between those
//! two is a submit that looks fresh and is not.
//!
//! # Two tags, because two resources have different state
//!
//! [`RowVersion`] is the tag of a **mutable row**, and it is what every `If-Match`
//! on the authoring plane names. [`PolicyTag`] is the tag of the tenant's
//! approval-threshold policy, which has no mutable row to version: the store is
//! append-only, so the thing a caller read is a *representation* composed of two
//! facts rather than a column. Both live here for the reason the paragraph above
//! gives — one rendering, shared by whoever emits a tag and whoever parses one
//! back — and both share [`strong_tag_body`], so neither reader can end up laxer
//! than the other on the wildcard, the weak validator and the list.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no increment** here. The bump belongs in SQL —
//! `row_version = row_version + 1` in the same atomic UPDATE that matches on
//! the version the caller read — so the successor is computed by the database
//! under the row lock and never by a caller. A `next()` on this type would let
//! two writers holding the same current version compute the same successor and
//! both write it: the silent overwrite the whole construct exists to prevent,
//! reintroduced by the helper meant to serve it.
