//! `PriceOverlayValidator` — **ten of `design/09-price-overlays.md` §3's eleven
//! `inst-plv-*` rules**, as one aggregate pipeline over a snapshot.
//!
//! Where [`crate::domain::overlay`] is the shapes, this module is the judgement:
//! `inst-plv-scope`, `inst-plv-lines`, `inst-plv-adjustment`,
//! `inst-plv-eligibility`, `inst-plv-precedence`, `inst-plv-class-tiebreak`,
//! `inst-plv-dating`, `inst-plv-referential` and `inst-plv-taxbasis`, with
//! `inst-plv-disclosure`'s catalog half discussed below. The one genuinely
//! outside this crate is `inst-plv-member-preview`, and the section on absences
//! says so.
//!
//! **This opened "the nine" and had counted its own contents one short** (review
//! Z3-8). The missing member was `inst-plv-class-tiebreak`, which the absences
//! section three screens down already records as being here *in both its halves*
//! — so a reader auditing coverage against §3 found a rule the census did not
//! claim, and the natural conclusion from a census is that an unclaimed rule is
//! unregistered. The count is kept rather than dropped because §3 has a fixed
//! roster to be audited against; what is corrected is which side of it each id
//! sits on.
//!
//! # One pipeline, not two, and D-213's shape found once
//!
//! The set runs **twice** — as a pre-check at submit and again inside the
//! publish-commit transaction (Foundation §4.2) — so every rule here is pure
//! with respect to the [`OverlayWorld`] it is handed, and none of them fetches
//! its own inputs. That is what makes one pipeline right rather than two: the
//! authoring-edge run and the publish-time run ask the *same* questions of two
//! different worlds, and a rule split across two pipelines would answer one of
//! them in only one of the runs.
//!
//! **One rule is genuinely outside it**, and it is D-213's shape one slice over:
//! [`check_tax_basis_declared`]. L5 says a basis MUST be declared and *silence
//! fails*, but `tax_basis` is `NOT NULL` in the store and [`TaxBasis`] is a
//! closed enum, so a **stored** overlay always has one and the publish-time arm
//! of that rule is unreachable. It therefore belongs to the authoring edge,
//! which is where the surface calls it from, and not to the walk below — a
//! pipeline taking `Option<TaxBasis>` would carry an arm no stored row can
//! reach. This is exactly `bundle_rules::check_basis_declared`'s argument, found
//! independently here.
//!
//! # Rules this module deliberately does **not** hold
//!
//! * **The scope pairing.** `(scope_class = 'global') = (scope_value = '')` is
//!   unrepresentable in [`ScopeSelector`], so there is no arm for it. What is
//!   left checkable — *is this value declared in its universe* — is
//!   [`check_scope`]'s, and the lookup is the repository's.
//! * **`fixed` is amount-based, a SKU line names its plan, a cohort line names
//!   its plan.** All three are unconstructible; see [`crate::domain::overlay`].
//! * **`inst-plv-disclosure`.** There is nothing here to *reject*: `disclosure`
//!   is a closed enum with a fail-closed default, and §3 step 7's rule is about
//!   **exposure** — the overlay is excluded from consumer-facing enumeration and
//!   from the base-price preview, while operator and service reads are
//!   explicitly unaffected. This gear mounts **no consumer-facing enumeration**
//!   (`GET /bss-pricing/v1/price-overlays` is the admin/Tariffs read), so the
//!   catalog's whole half of that rule is: carry the flag, default it
//!   `restricted`, publish it. The exclusion half has no subject in this crate
//!   and is owed by Presentation and the Tariffs preview (F-34). Stated here
//!   rather than left as a missing rule, because an absent arm reads as an
//!   oversight.
//! * **`inst-plv-class-tiebreak`** is here in **both** its halves: the class
//!   order it publishes is [`ScopeClass`]'s derived `Ord`, because the read
//!   model has to carry it, and the cross-class equal-precedence *warning* it
//!   also asks for is [`EQUAL_PRECEDENCE_CROSS_CLASS_TIE`], raised by
//!   [`check_cross_class_tie`] over the ties `overlay_repo` collects. *(This
//!   paragraph called the warning "owed" for as long as it existed beside the
//!   rule that raises it — an owed-arm note is read as a to-do list, so one
//!   naming something already built sends a reader to write it twice.)*
//! * **`inst-plv-member-preview`** is outside this strand's census: it belongs
//!   to the Tariffs preview and has no subject in this crate.
//!
//! # The direction D-138's warning needs, and does not have
//!
//! [`FIXED_LINE_DISCARDS_STACK`] fires when a `fixed` line *"is not the
//! lowest-precedence layer able to match its target"*. That condition presumes
//! the stack is applied from the low end: under the opposite reading a `fixed`
//! at a higher precedence is applied **first** and discards nothing, while a
//! `fixed` at the lowest precedence discards everything above it — so the
//! warning's condition is exactly **inverted**. §F.1 records the sort direction
//! as undecided and the brief for this strand says not to encode one.
//!
//! What is built here is D-138's own words, literally: the predicate compares
//! numeric precedence and warns on a non-minimum matching `fixed` layer. That is
//! not a choice of direction — it is the condition D-138 states — but it is only
//! *correct* under one of the two readings, and a warning that fires on the
//! wrong half of the cases is worse than no warning. It is an `[H]` entry in the
//! owed register: the decision is the owner's, and this is the one place in the
//! strand where its absence is load-bearing rather than academic.
