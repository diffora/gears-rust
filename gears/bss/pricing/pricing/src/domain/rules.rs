//! The Slice-3 **price-row shape rules** (`design/03-price-structure.md`).
//!
//! Each instruction of the slice becomes one
//! [`ValidationRule`](crate::domain::validation::ValidationRule) over a
//! [`PriceRow`], registered into the Foundation's pipeline. The rules append and
//! never short-circuit: a row with a missing kind *and* a closed top band
//! reports both, because the author remediates a plan in one pass.
//!
//! The `const` codes below are the contract. They are the machine-readable
//! discriminators the design set names verbatim (§5), they are what the
//! conformance corpus's publish cases assert, and they are what an RFC 9457
//! response carries — so they are written once, here, and referenced everywhere
//! rather than spelled at each `report.violate` call site.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately absent
//!
//! `inst-la-units` (the meter must be gauge-kind and the SKU-declared billable
//! unit must equal `level unit x granule`) and `inst-la-composite` (a non-`sum`
//! function on a derived meter) are **not implemented here**. Both are
//! cross-entity checks against the product registry, and this gear has no
//! registry client yet. They are left out rather than stubbed: a rule that
//! always passes is indistinguishable from a rule that holds, and it would make
//! `LEVEL_UNIT_MISMATCH` and `LEVEL_COMPOSITE_FORBIDDEN` read as enforced when
//! nothing enforces them.
