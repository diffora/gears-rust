//! The publish unit's vocabulary: what is published, on whose authority, and
//! what the commit hands back.
//!
//! `design/01-foundation.md` §4.2 is one path with five steps, and this module
//! names the three values that path carries. It runs no rule and touches no
//! store — those are [`crate::domain::plan_rules`] and
//! [`crate::infra::publish`] respectively — because the words have to be
//! agreed before either can be written against them.
//!
//! ## Two publish units, one type, and the criterion that decided it
//!
//! [`PlanPublishUnit`] carries a [`PublishUnitKind`] discriminator. It used to be
//! a struct with no kind at all, over a paragraph that said the second unit would
//! either get its own type or make this one grow a discriminator, *"and either way
//! the decision is made with the second unit in hand rather than guessed at now."*
//! **The second unit is in hand.** D-99 makes every window *mutation* — a
//! schedule, a future-`effectiveTo` adjustment, a cancellation — a publish unit
//! through this same engine path.
//!
//! **The criterion is the subject, and it is the design set's own, not one
//! invented here.** `01-foundation.md` §3.7 keys `pricing_read_model` on
//! `subject_kind ∈ {plan, price_overlay, overlay_index, group_membership}` and
//! D-157 puts that same pair on `pricing_catalog_version_ref`, so **which subject
//! a unit projects is a declared, enumerated fact about it**. Hence:
//!
//! > A publish unit that projects a **different subject** gets its own type. A
//! > publish unit that projects the **same subject** and differs only in which of
//! > its facts moved gets a variant.
//!
//! Applied to the four kinds §4.2 names, the criterion says something different
//! about each rather than "add a variant every time":
//!
//! - **window mutations** (D-99) — *"windows are plan facts, so they need no
//!   subject kind of their own"*, verbatim. Same `plan` subject, same
//!   `(plan_id, revision)`, same re-projection. **A variant**, and it is here.
//! - **plan retirement** (D-128) — the `published → retired` flip re-projects the
//!   plan subject and pins that same revision number. Same subject: **a variant**,
//!   owed by the group that builds retirement.
//! - **the `PriceOverlay` unit** and **customer-group membership** (D-06) — each
//!   projects `price_overlay` / `group_membership`, and the overlay unit projects
//!   a *second* subject with it (the D-112/D-133 `overlay_index` shard). Different
//!   subjects, and one of them plural: **their own types**, with their own subject
//!   refs and their own revisions, when Slice 9 lands them.
//!
//! **What the rejected option would have cost.** A sibling `WindowPublishUnit`
//! would restate the plan identity, the revision, and every field
//! [`PublishService::commit`](crate::infra::publish::PublishService::commit) reads
//! off the unit — `unit.plan_id` for the assembly, `unit.revision` for the
//! shape-equality check that refuses a moved draft, both again for the pending
//! ref's `subject_revision` and for the registry request id. Two carriers of one
//! subject are two things free to disagree about **which revision a version
//! froze**, on the path whose whole discipline is that the commit flips exactly
//! the row set its re-validation judged (D-155). The discriminator makes that
//! disagreement unrepresentable: there is one subject, and the kind says only what
//! moved.
//!
//! **What the discriminator is deliberately not.** It is not a `subject_kind`.
//! Nothing here or downstream writes `window` into `pricing_read_model` or into
//! `pricing_catalog_version_ref` — D-99 forbids it in as many words — and nothing
//! here extends `AuditSubjectKind`, which D-158 binds to
//! `chk_pricing_approval_subject_kind` as one enumeration extended only beside its
//! writer.
//!
//! **What is not built.** The commit's own handling of a window mutation is not in
//! this group: [`PublishService::commit`](crate::infra::publish::PublishService::commit)
//! still assembles the plan's **open draft revision** and refuses a unit whose
//! revision is not the draft's, while a window mutation is a unit over the plan's
//! *current published* revision. So today the discriminator changes exactly one
//! observable thing — the registry `request_id`, so the two units of one revision
//! cannot dedup onto each other — and the group that builds `WindowService` owes
//! the commit path that reads the kind. **Reported**, rather than left for that
//! group to discover from a signature that already admits their unit.
//!
//! ## The approval gate is a value, not a call
//!
//! [`PublishAuthorization`] has no `Default` and no third arm, so
//! `PublishService::commit` cannot be called without a decision having been
//! made. That is the whole of what the commit genuinely needs from Slice 5:
//! **that it cannot proceed undecided**, and that whatever was decided reaches
//! the audit trail (`inst-au-complete`, `inst-tp-record`).
//!
//! What this deliberately is **not** is the approval workflow. Slice 5's
//! surface is the `MaterialityEvaluator` over a registered-trigger set owned by
//! eight slices (`inst-mat-registered` names D-10, D-13, D-50, D-62, D-104,
//! D-109 and D-115 in one paragraph), the `pricing_approval` store — which has
//! no migration and no entity in this crate — the content pin and its
//! `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH`, the withdraw path and the approver scope check.
//! None of it is reachable from anywhere today, because this gear has no
//! authoring REST surface at all. Building it here would put that workflow in
//! front of the five moves the publish commit exists to make, and would shape it
//! with no caller to shape it against.
//!
//! The consequence is stated rather than hidden: **nothing in this crate can
//! mint a [`PublishAuthorization`] today except a test.** That costs exactly
//! nothing while no surface can reach the commit, and it becomes the approval
//! group's first obligation the moment one can.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately absent
//!
//! The two-person rule's `submitter != approver` check (`inst-tp-distinct`) is
//! **not** asserted by [`PublishAuthorization::approved`], even though the
//! comparison is one line. `inst-tp-selfaudit` binds the refusal to an audit
//! record of the *attempted violation*, written against the approval's own
//! subject — and there is no approval record and no approval `chain_id` for
//! that record to extend. Enforcing half the rule here would give it two
//! owners, free to disagree the day the other half lands, which is the defect
//! this crate's single-owner discipline exists to prevent. So the type
//! **carries** both principals, which is what makes the trail complete, and the
//! check plus its audited refusal stay whole in Slice 5's group.
//! `SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN` therefore gets no constant here: a code declared
//! where nothing raises it reads as enforcement to everyone who greps for it.
