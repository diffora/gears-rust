//! The guard that makes the generation worth stamping.
//!
//! Every assertion here is anchored in `design/01-foundation.md` §4.4 rather
//! than in this crate. That is the whole design: a guard whose expectation lives
//! beside the code it guards is satisfied by the same edit that breaks it, and a
//! generation satisfied that way is a constant asserting a stability nobody
//! checked — on posted money, where the segment's only job is to tell one
//! evaluation semantics from another.
//!
//! What an author adding a field to `PriceRow` meets, in order:
//!
//! 1. **A compile error** in `partition_row_fields` (E0027) — no rest pattern,
//!    so the field must be named and classified.
//! 2. **`the_roster_is_the_documents_roster`** or
//!    **`the_out_of_roster_set_is_the_documents`**, depending on which side they
//!    put it — the document has not heard of the field either way.
//! 3. If the field is rostered, making that green needs a **new log line**, and
//!    `the_declared_generation_is_the_last_one_in_the_log` plus
//!    `the_crate_stamps_the_generation_the_document_declares` then require the
//!    document's generation and this crate's constant to move with it.
//!
//! The one evasion left open is editing an existing log line, and it is left
//! open on purpose: backdating a field into a past generation falsifies what a
//! numbered decision admitted, in a normative document. That is not a shortcut
//! through a guard, it is a different act.
