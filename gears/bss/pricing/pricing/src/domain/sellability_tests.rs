//! What each predicate answers, and the world in which that predicate is the

//!
//! **Every instant here is a parameter, not a clock.** `at(day)` is a fixed
//! instant and the `at` every case evaluates against is passed in, so no case can
//! start passing or failing because today's date moved past it — which is the
//! whole property that makes a frozen version answer a past order instant the same
//! way forever.
//!
//! The staging discipline these cases follow: each starts from `sellable_facts()`,
//! a world in which every answerable predicate is satisfied, and changes **one**
//! fact. So the predicate under test is the one that answers, and `only_failure_is`
//! names the others as still satisfied — the observability twin a refusal needs,
//! because a rule that refused everything would pass its own refusal test.
