//! The **aggregate** publish rule set: one report over one publish subject.
//!
//! Until this module the rules existed as disconnected pipelines — thirteen
//! Slice-3 rules over a [`PriceRow`], twenty Slice-2 rules over a [`PlanShape`],
//! one supersession guard over a pair — each registered and none of them run by
//! anything but a test and a dev-only conformance validator.
//! [`run_publish_rules`] is what §4.2 step 2 and step 4 actually call, and it is
//! the same call in both: approval approves *content*, the commit re-validates
//! *state*, and the only way those two runs can be compared is if they are the
//! same function over the same subject.
//!
//! # Order is a reading order, never a short-circuit
//!
//! [`ValidationPipeline::run`] runs every rule and the aggregate report is the
//! product — an author remediates a plan in one pass. What the order decides is
//! how the report **reads**, and it is fixed here: the per-row rules first, then
//! the plan-shape set. That is the conformance validator's own argument
//! (`examples/regen_registry/validator.rs`): a malformed row is malformed
//! regardless of the plan it sits in, while a plan-level rule is a statement
//! *about a set of rows* and reads oddly ahead of the news that one of them is
//! not a row at all.
//!
//! The **slice-7 coverage set runs last**, after both plan-level sets, for the
//! same reason: `inst-wc-required` is a statement about a key's window plane, and
//! a report that named an uncovered key before it named the row that is not a row
//! reads back to front. [`window_coverage_rules`] is registered here as its own
//! pipeline — not appended to `foundation_plan_rules`, whose doc reserves that
//! place for the next *Foundation* rule, and not to Slice 2's set, which
//! `GrandfatherHorizonOnItsClass` already argues a slice-7 rule cannot join.
//!
//! Within the row half the Foundation's own rule runs after Slice 3's, because
//! Slice 3 answers "is this a row" and the rounding rule answers "does this row
//! resolve the policy every charge's last minor unit depends on" — the second
//! question presupposes the first.
//!
//! # `supersession_rules` is not run here, and that is not an oversight
//!
//! It takes a `SupersessionPair`, and **this** publish unit produces no successor
//! on an occupied key: `PriceRepo::create_draft` refuses a scope key already held
//! by a `draft` **or** `published` row, so nothing the plan-revision publish
//! authors can set `supersedes_price_id`.
//!
//! **One clause of that argument has expired and the conclusion has not.** It used
//! to close "the two sanctioned producers of that flip are Slice 7's and neither
//! exists", and D-88's **row half** exists as of 2026-08-05:
//! `price_repo::insert_successor_draft_on` authors a successor draft on an occupied
//! key through a door of its own and stamps `supersedes_price_id` from the
//! predecessor it found (D-195), and `commit_supersession_rows` flips the
//! predecessor. **The compose exists too** — `domain::supersession::plan_supersession`,
//! which runs this very guard (corrected 2026-08-05: this paragraph was written before
//! that landed, later in the same commit series, and denied it for a day). What does
//! **not** exist is the orchestrator, the approval unit and the route, so no *surface*
//! reaches any of it — and the pair this guard judges still cannot arrive on **this**
//! path in any case: the supersession unit is its own publish unit and runs the guard
//! itself (`inst-su-compose`). The clause is corrected rather than deleted, because a
//! premise resting on a fact that has changed is a premise a later reader will
//! believe for the wrong reason.
//!
//! So the guard still has no pair to judge here, and running it over a fabricated
//! one would be a rule reporting on a subject nobody authored. **The supersession
//! unit does run it**, in `plan_supersession`; what is owed is the surface that
//! reaches that function.
//!
//! # The Foundation's base set: what is enforced structurally, and what was
//! missing
//!
//! [`crate::domain::validation`] says the Foundation "registers the money and
//! rounding rules itself rather than leaving the base set to whichever slice
//! happens to load first", and §3.3 says `ROUNDING_POLICY_UNRESOLVED` is
//! "registered into the pipeline by the Foundation itself". Of those:
//!
//! - **The money rules need no pipeline rule, because they are unrepresentable
//!   failures.** `MinorAmount::new` refuses a negative (`AMOUNT_NEGATIVE`),
//!   `CurrencyCode::new` refuses a non-ISO-4217 code (`CURRENCY_INVALID`), and
//!   `check_scale` / `check_decimal` carry `PRECISION_EXCEEDED`. A [`PriceRow`]
//!   cannot hold a violation of any of them, so a rule here would be a rule with
//!   nothing to reject — and a rule that always passes is indistinguishable from
//!   a rule that holds. The absence is a decision, recorded so it reads as one.
//! - **The rounding rule was genuinely missing.** `DomainError::RoundingPolicyUnresolved`
//!   existed and was mapped, `pricing_price.rounding_policy_ref` existed,
//!   `pricing_policy_object.default_rounding_policy_ref` existed — and **no rule
//!   read any of them**, so a row that resolved neither would have published.
//!   [`RoundingPolicyResolved`] is that rule.
//!
//! # The §14 soft caps are an advisory, and the code is now the set's
//!
//! §1.2's NFR allocation names "publish-time size validation (100 bands/row, 500
//! rows/plan soft)" and PRD §14 says the system **SHOULD** enforce them "emitting
//! a publish **warning** above the cap". An earlier version of this doc reported
//! the whole thing as a gap for one reason and one only: no document named an
//! advisory code. D-160 named it — `PLAN_SIZE_SOFT_CAP_EXCEEDED`, in
//! `01-foundation.md` §3.3 — so [`PlanSizeWithinSoftCaps`] is the rule.
//!
//! **It never blocks.** The finding rides `warnings[]`, the channel
//! `TIER_BAND_PRICE_INCREASE` already uses, and `is_publishable()` does not read
//! it. Making the caps blocking so they could reuse a violation code is D-160's
//! rejected option (b): a ratified `SHOULD` enforced as a `MUST` is a plan an
//! operator could author yesterday and cannot publish today.
//!
//! **The two *interval* caps are a different thing and stay hard.** §1.2's
//! allocation row had blurred all four under one heading; D-160 unblurs them.
//! `customEveryN` bounds fail publish under
//! [`INVALID_CUSTOM_INTERVAL`](crate::domain::plan_rules::INVALID_CUSTOM_INTERVAL)
//! and this rule must never reach them — a soft advisory over a hard cap would
//! tell an author their over-cap interval published.
//!
//! # What is deliberately absent
//!
//! **The fixture gate is not a rule and is not run here.** `FixtureGate::check`
//! returns `DomainError::FixtureMissing` and stays a separate fail-closed step
//! beside the report; [`crate::infra::publish`] is where the two meet. Two
//! reasons. It is not a statement about the plan but about what this
//! deployment's joint corpus has agreed to evaluate, so its remedy is not an
//! edit the author can make — which is the whole difference between a violation
//! and a refusal. And synthesizing a violation from it needs a code, which this
//! group will not mint on its own authority.
