//! The **canonical scope key** and its ten axes.
//!
//! One key serves four jobs at once (`design/01-foundation.md` §4.1): row
//! uniqueness, supersession scoping, `PriceWindow` non-overlap, and window
//! ownership. That is why it is a type rather than a tuple assembled per call
//! site — every one of those four rules has to agree, to the axis, about what
//! "the same key" means.
//!
//! ```text
//! (planId, currency, region, priceOverlay, phase, priceEligibility, chargeKind,
//!  cohort, meter, dimensionKey)
//! ```
//!
//! It extends the manifest's `(plan, currency, region, priceOverlay)` key
//! **additively** with `phase`, `priceEligibility`, `chargeKind` (ADR
//! `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-adr-canonical-scope-key`) and `cohort` (ADR
//! `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-adr-grandfathering-cohort-axis`), and supersedes it for
//! normative purposes.
//!
//! Axis defaults: `priceOverlay = base`, `priceEligibility = all_subscriptions`,
//! `cohort = none`. `phase` also has a default — the plan's terminal phase id —
//! but it is **data, not a constant**, so it is not a `Default` impl on
//! [`PhaseId`]; see that type.
//!
//! # The ninth and tenth axes (D-196), and they are built
//!
//! **D-196 is the product owner's decision and all four clauses
//! are paid.** The canonical scope key carries `(meter, dimensionKey)` **on
//! `chargeKind = 'usage'` rows**, because every usage line of one plan in one
//! market otherwise rendered one key and the second was refused
//! `DUPLICATE_SCOPE_KEY` at save — which made D-103's confirmed multi-meter plan
//! unstorable while the meter-line index, `MeterInjectivity` and
//! `plan_rules::cycle_shape_tests` all assumed it storable.
//!
//! The pairing rule is an implication and not a biconditional — a meter implies
//! `usage`, while a usage row with no meter stays admissible ([`ScopeKey::new`]
//! returns exactly that, and [`ScopeKey::with_usage_line`] is never needed to
//! omit the pair). [`fmt::Display`] keeps **fixed arity at ten segments**, `none`
//! filling both usage positions on a key that has no line. The physical half is
//! §3.7's: `meter` is nullable and NULLs are distinct inside a `UNIQUE`, so the
//! two scope-key indexes key over `COALESCE(meter, '')` — measured rather than
//! assumed, because the naive spelling *destroys* the uniqueness every non-usage
//! key had.
//!
//! **A module doc that describes the state of the work is load-bearing and goes
//! stale in the same commit that finishes it.** This paragraph is the instruction a
//! reader consults before deciding whether a neighbouring "eight axes" needs
//! revisiting: while it reads as unbuilt, every such site reads as correct.
//! `scope_key_columns`, `content_pin::put_scope_key`, `sellability::siblings` and
//! `ScopeKeyView` each had to be found separately, by four different routes.

/// available only inside this module. Every site outside it reached in through
/// accessors one axis at a time, which compiles unchanged when the key grows —
/// and D-196, which widened this key from eight axes to ten, is the record of
/// what that costs. The sweep that widened it missed three sites, and two of the
/// three shipped a defect:
///
/// - `price_repo.rs`'s row comparator, which reading eight columns of a ten-axis
///   key makes read a successor on a **different meter of the same market** as
///   being on the predecessor's key.
/// - `content_pin.rs`'s digest, which framing eight axes makes pin two window
///   plans on two meters of one market identically — so an approve is satisfied
///   by a re-derivation over the other line's coverage. That is an approval
///   bypass, and it has shipped once.
///
/// A stale-count grep cannot find these sites, which is why the last sweep missed
/// three. A destructure can: add an axis to [`ScopeKey`] and every consumer that
/// takes its parts stops compiling until it says what to do with the new one.
///
/// # What this does *not* gate
///
/// **Four sites**, not three, and their cover is not the same. All four build or
/// compare a key **from** a stored row or a JSON payload rather than consuming a
/// `ScopeKey`, so none of them can take its parts.
///
/// Three of them — `price_repo::to_scope_key`, `price_repo::scope_key_columns`,
/// `read_model_repo::read_scope_key` — have [`ScopeKey::new`]'s positional
/// signature as a partial cover, and that cover fails for exactly the widening
/// D-196 performed: an axis pair added through a `with_*` builder rather than a
/// constructor parameter, which is how `meter` and `dimension_key` arrived.
///
/// **`price_repo::market_columns` has no cover at all.** It touches no
/// constructor — it is a bare eight-element tuple literal off `price::Model` — so
/// neither kind
/// of widening reaches it, and it is deliberately *partial* ("all of them but
/// `priceEligibility` and `cohort`"), which is what makes an omission invisible
/// there: an eleventh axis silently absent does not read as "eight of ten", it
/// reads as "modulo three axes", which is the shape the function is supposed to
/// have. It also decides `refuse_ungenerational`, the row plane's last guard
