//! The materiality evaluator — `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-algo-materiality`
//! (`design/05-governance.md` §3), steps 1, 2, 3, 3a and 4.
//!
//! One question: does this change set need a second principal, or may it
//! publish on one? [`evaluate`] answers it, and the design set's G1 fixes the
//! default direction — **material unless proved otherwise**. Five rules make
//! a change material, and this module is exactly those five:
//!
//! | Rule | The world it refuses to auto-publish |
//! |---|---|
//! | `inst-mat-registered` | the act, or its content, is on §3 step 4's trigger list |
//! | `inst-mat-failsafe` | the tenant has no explicitly configured threshold policy |
//! | `inst-mat-first` | the plan has no published baseline, so no delta is computable |
//! | `inst-mat-newrow` | a row in the change set has no baseline row of its own |
//! | `inst-mat-percurrency` | a row's delta reaches its **own currency's** threshold, or its currency has no entry |
//!
//! Five rules and **five** reasons, and the pairing is not one-to-one:
//! `inst-mat-percurrency` answers with two of them, because "no entry for this
//! currency" and "reached the entry it has" are two states an operator acts on
//! differently. [`MaterialityReason`] is the roster.
//!
//! [`MaterialityVerdict::AutoPublishable`] is what is left when all five
//! decline, and §3 states that residue in one sentence: *"a pure amount change on
//! unchanged geometry, below an explicitly configured threshold, not a first
//! publish."* It is the arm [`PublishAuthorization::auto_publishable`] says must
//! not be reached by an evaluator that cannot answer.
//!
//! [`PublishAuthorization::auto_publishable`]:
//! crate::domain::publish::PublishAuthorization::auto_publishable
//!
//! # The verdict carries which rule fired, and that is not decoration
//!
//! A bool would make the arms one event. Three things need them kept
//! apart. `pricing_approval.materiality` is a stored column an auditor reads
//! years later, and "material" alone does not say whether a reviewer was
//! required because the tenant never configured a policy or because a new
//! market row appeared. An operator told only "approval required" cannot tell
//! which of them they could act on — only the threshold ones are a configuration
//! they own, and a registered trigger is not a configuration at all. And a test
//! suite that asserts materiality without asserting *which rule produced it*
//! cannot tell an implemented arm from a missing one: every such assertion
//! passes against `fn evaluate(..) -> Material`. The reason is
//! what makes each arm removable-and-observable one at a time.
//!
//! # Two things named "baseline", and they are not the same thing
//!
//! [`crate::domain::plan_shape::PublishedBaseline`] already exists and is the
//! **plan shape's** referent: the terminal phase id, the phases in use and the
//! published availability window, for three Slice-2 rules that are comparisons.
//! It carries no price rows at all, so `inst-mat-newrow` — "has *this row* a
//! baseline of its own" — cannot be asked of it.
//!
//! [`PublishedPriceBaseline`] is the price-row referent, and it is a separate
//! type with a distinguishable name rather than a field added to the other one.
//! Two rules with different subjects sharing one carrier is how a rule silently
//! acquires a second owner, and a reader who greps `PublishedBaseline` should
//! not have to work out which of two meanings the hit has.
//!
//! # An empty policy object is not a configured policy
//!
//! [`ThresholdPolicy::of_entries`] answers `None` for an empty entry set, so
//! `inst-mat-failsafe` sees it as the absence it is. The design set makes the
//! per-currency reading explicit — *"the G1 fail-safe applies per currency, not
//! per policy object"* — and a policy object carrying zero entries has a
//! threshold for no currency at all. Admitting one as "configured" would let a
//! tenant clear every entry and auto-publish everything, which is the fail-open
//! this rule exists to close.
//!
//! # The three parts that were absent, and what answers them now
//!
//! This section used to name three deliberate absences and state, as an
//! obligation, what they would cost the group that changed them. **This is that
//! group**, so the section is answered rather than deleted: the reachability
//! argument below is kept as the history it is, because a reader meeting
//! [`evaluate`] still needs to know which of its silences were decisions and which
//! of its rules arrived together — and because the obligation it states is the one
//! that decided this group's shape.
//!
//! | Was absent | Answers it now |
//! |---|---|
//! | Per-currency thresholds and the delta comparison (§3 step 3, `inst-mat-percurrency`) | [`evaluate`]'s row walk, against [`ThresholdPolicy::entry`] |
//! | The D-115 delta domain | [`delta::row_delta`] |
//! | The registered always-material triggers (§3 step 4, `inst-mat-registered`) | [`triggers`] |
//!
//! **The reachability argument, as history.** All three were unreachable while
//! `policy` was always `None`, and it was always `None` because no threshold policy
//! could exist: there was no store, no `GET/PUT
//! /bss-pricing/v1/config/approval-threshold-policy`, and — decisively — **D-10
//! makes that PUT itself an always-material act**. That last clause has not
//! changed and is now the bootstrap rather than the reason for an absence: a
//! tenant still cannot configure a threshold without first completing an approved
//! unit, because the PUT's own unit is `Trigger::ThresholdPolicyDiff`. *"A
//! single-reviewer tenant simply leaves the policy unset ⇒ everything material"*
//! is still the design set's own sentence and still what this module does.
//!
//! **What it cost this group, and it is why the four parts landed together.** The
//! moment [`ThresholdPolicy::of_entries`] acquired a production caller, an
//! evaluator that examined neither the threshold nor the triggers would have
//! answered [`MaterialityVerdict::AutoPublishable`] for an **above**-threshold
//! change and for **every** registered trigger — precisely the fail-open the design
//! set has closed by hand five times (D-50, D-62, D-104, D-109, D-115). So the
//! policy store, the delta domain, the trigger registry and this evaluator are one
//! change, not a sequence.
//!
//! **Six registered triggers still name subjects this crate cannot author** — a
//! bulk group move, a retirement that unwinds a live cutover, a historical import,
//! the two gate-clearing republishes, a prepaid grant's non-price fields. (The
//! sentence said "most", and named cutovers, overlays, memberships, bundles and
//! **retirement** among them; each of those has since landed, and retirement had
//! landed before this paragraph was last touched.) **A seventh answers `false` on
//! different grounds**: `revenueShareChange`'s subject is authored here and no
//! surface declares the act, `infra::bundle::rev_share_change_set` being a
//! constructor nothing calls (D-232, D-321). They are not omitted:
//! [`triggers::Trigger`] declares
//! each with its owning slice and answers
//! [`triggers::Trigger::subject_exists_in_this_crate`] `false`, so the set does not
//! read as half-built and no token claims a writer it has not got.
//!
//! **All four window acts are decided here, and the division of labour is the only
//! thing left outside.** [`crate::infra::window`] decides *inside its mutating
//! transaction* whether a `PATCH` shortens (D-176 — a classification made before the
//! transaction opened is a hint) and hands that fact over as
//! [`ChangeSet::of_window_mutation`]'s `act`; [`evaluate`] turns it into a verdict.
//! This paragraph used to say the same thing about `ChangeSet::of_act` and it was one
//! group early: `infra::window` wrote `material(AlwaysMaterialTrigger)` by hand on its
//! controlled arm and never called this function at all, which is exactly the second
//! owner the sentence warned against. Now a second copy of §3 step 4 per caller does
//! not exist, because no caller has one.
//!
//! What a **window mutation** brings to the row walk is worth stating, because it is
//! the only production caller that reaches it: its change set is the plan's published
//! rows, unchanged, so every delta is zero and no bar is ever reached. The rule that
//! decides a schedule or a lengthening is therefore `inst-mat-percurrency`'s fail-safe
//! half — has this plan's currency an entry at all.
//!
//! **"Implementing half a registered instruction gives it two owners, free to
//! disagree the day the other half lands."** That sentence stood here against
//! `inst-mat-percurrency`'s cheap fail-closed half, and it is **discharged rather
//! than wrong**: both halves of that instruction land in this change — the
//! per-currency comparison and the no-entry fail-safe — so the instruction has one
//! owner and it is [`evaluate`]. The argument itself still holds and
//! [`crate::domain::publish`] still makes it for `inst-tp-distinct`.
