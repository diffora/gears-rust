/// `of_act(Trigger::` would answer `false` for two triggers that are produced,
/// and would have to be widened by hand every time a third spelling appears. The
/// census's question is *"does this crate's code name it"*, and the honest way to
/// narrow a textual match to that is to remove what is not code.
///
/// `crate::source_scan` is that removal, and it is **the same instrument**
/// `approval_repo_tests` uses to tell a writer of an `AuditSubjectKind` from a
/// doc comment quoting one — one reading, not two.
///
/// # A site nothing reaches produces nothing either, and that is the third axis
///
/// Both census directions asked whether the crate **names** the trigger. That is
/// not the same question as whether the crate can **answer** it, and the two came
/// apart on `revenueShareChange` (D-321): its only naming site was the body of
/// `infra::bundle::rev_share_change_set`, then a `pub fn` with no caller anywhere in
/// `src/` — so the trigger was "produced" by a function nothing calls, and the
/// `true` beside it read to every reader as *"this crate declares the act"*. The
/// register had said as much in prose since D-232 — *"a `pub fn` that builds a
/// change set is not a surface declaring an act"* — while neither instrument could
/// see it.
///
/// So a naming site counts only when the function containing it is **named
/// somewhere else in this crate's code**. Three properties of that, stated rather
/// than assumed:
///
/// * **It is one link, not a closure.** A closure needs a root set, and this
///   crate's roots are reached through a proc-macro expansion — `#[toolkit::gear]`
///   dispatches `serve`/`init` through a trait, and the entry name appears only
///   inside a string literal the blanking removes — so a transitive walk would
///   report the whole router dead and every trigger unproduced. One link catches
///   the defect that has now occurred three times (a constructor with **zero**
///   callers); a producer reached only from a caller that is itself unreached
///   would still pass, and that is the residual.
/// * **A definition sharing a name with another is credited with the other's
///   callers.** `fn new` is named everywhere. That errs toward calling a site
///   reachable, which weakens the census and never reddens it falsely.
/// * **A `_tests.rs` caller is not a caller**, for the same reason a test is not a

///   by a case asserting about it is exactly the state `bulkGroupMove` was in.

/// published against the last one that was ever live — together with
/// `MaterialityVerdict::trigger`, which makes its answer readable. A declaration
/// nothing can observe is not a declaration, and satisfying the instrument would
/// have been the instrument gamed by its own fix.
///
/// **`bulkGroupMove` left this list on 2026-08-14**, and it should never have
/// joined it: the flip credited `ApprovalService::submit_membership_move_on` with
