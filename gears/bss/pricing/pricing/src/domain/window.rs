//! The price window's state machine — `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-state-price-window`
//! (`design/07-pricewindow-linkage.md` §4), its interval arithmetic, and the four
//! §5 refusals that are about a window rather than about a plan.
//!
//! A window is one half-open interval `[effectiveFrom, effectiveTo)` a price row
//! is effective over. Everything here is total and pure: the four states, the
//! edges between them, the containment arithmetic every consumer of a frozen
//! delta re-derives "active at `t`" from, and five checked forms a surface calls
//! before it attempts a mutation.
//!
//! **The transition table lives here rather than in the repository** for the
//! reason `ApprovalState::decide` lives in the domain: the store's compare-and-swap
//! and the migration's trigger arm are both *physical* halves of one rule, and a
//! rule with three spellings needs one of them to be the statement the other two
//! are checked against. `window_repo` consults this and then carries its own
//! `state = <expected>` predicate into the `UPDATE`, exactly as
//! `approval_repo::decide` does; the trigger is what an ad-hoc `UPDATE` meets.
//! [`transition`] is that statement's checked form and **delegates** to
//! [`WindowState::may_move_to`]; it does not restate the table, because a second
//! spelling of an edge set is a second answer to which edges exist.
//!
//! # Which refusals are the store's and which are a surface's
//!
//! The line is one criterion, and it is worth stating once because §5 declares
//! eight codes and this module implements four of them:
//!
//! **The store answers what it also enforces physically; a surface answers what
//! only a request can be judged against.**
//!
//! - `WINDOW_OVERLAP` and `WINDOW_HISTORICAL_IMMUTABLE` are the store's. Both
//!   have a physical half —
//!   `trg_pricing_price_window_append_only`'s immutable-history and
//!   future-`effective_to` arms, and §6's "inside every mutation" for the
//!   overlap — so the store is where the rule already lives, and a pre-check
//!   there is what turns a trigger's 500 into the 409 §5 names.
//!   [`crate::infra::storage::repo::window_repo`] raises both.
//! - `WINDOW_START_IN_PAST` and `WINDOW_NOT_CANCELLABLE` are a surface's. Neither
//!   has a physical half and neither can have one: "strictly in the future"
//!   compares against the instant a **request** arrived, and "only a not-yet-active
//!   window cancels" is about which operation the caller asked for, which a row
//!   does not carry. [`check_creation`] and [`check_cancellation`] are their sole
//!   producers.
//!
//! **All four are now raised by a mounted surface, and the sentence that used to
//! stand here is withdrawn.** It read that "there is no window route and no
//! `WindowService`", so [`check_creation`] and [`check_cancellation`] were "called by
//! their tests and by nothing else" — true when it was written and false since the
//! three §5 window surfaces landed. `WindowService::schedule` calls the first and
//! `cancel` the second, both before the store, which is what turns a trigger's 500
//! into the 409 §5 names. The posture that sentence contrasted with is unchanged and
//! still worth keeping: `SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN` got **no constant** while nothing
//! raised it, because there the enforcement itself was absent and a constant would
//! have read as a guard that existed.
//!
//! # `WINDOW_COVERAGE_MISSING`, `WINDOW_GAP`, `WINDOW_TRAILING_VOID` and
//! `AVAILABILITY_OUTSIDE_COVERAGE` are not here
//!
//! The remaining §5 codes are coverage's, not one window's — and the roster above is
//! the whole of them rather than a count, because a count beside a roster is a
//! sentence that stops being true when the roster grows. Each ranges over **every**
//! window of a canonical scope key, which is what puts them one plane up from this
//! module: `inst-wc-required`, `inst-fg-detect`, `inst-fg-trailing` and
//! `inst-wc-availability` in order. One of the four — `WINDOW_TRAILING_VOID` — needs
//! two inputs none of the others do: W6's longest billing cycle (D-80) and the D-79
//! inbound subscriber lane, the latter because `inst-fg-trailing`'s only exemption is
//! about in-flight subscribers. `CoverageChecker` owns all four; a code declared here
//! would put them under two owners the day it lands.
