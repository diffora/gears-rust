//! Tests for the Slice-2 rule-code contract.
//!
//! The constants are a contract with three parties that never see this crate's
//! source: the conformance corpus, an RFC 9457 consumer, and
//! `design/02-plan-definition.md` §5, which spells every one of them. A
//! constant whose value drifted from its name would still compile, would still
//! be referenced at every `report.violate` site, and would be wrong on the
//! wire — so the spelling is asserted byte for byte against §5 rather than
//! against the identifier.
