//! Tests for `evaluate` — **and for the direction that makes them mean
//! something**.
//!
//! Every material-side assertion here passes against `fn evaluate(..) -> Material`,
//! which is the shape of a feature that was never built. They are evidence only
//! alongside [`a_below_threshold_amount_change_on_unchanged_geometry_auto_publishes`],
//! which is the **only** shape that auto-publishes and is §3's own sentence for the
//! residue: *"a pure amount change on unchanged geometry, below an explicitly
//! configured threshold, not a first publish."*
//!
//! Phase 3 proved a fail-safe was a rule and not an absent feature, by injecting a
//! policy at the domain level because no surface could produce one. This phase
//! proves the other direction, and each of the four halves the group landed —
//! the threshold comparison, the delta domain's geometry clause, the per-currency
//! fail-safe and the trigger registry — **flips it back independently**. Four
//! cases, not one, because one case cannot tell an implemented arm from a missing
//! one; that is the argument this module's own doc makes about the three reasons.
//!
//! Each material-side test puts the world in the state where **its own** rule is
//! the one that can answer: the auto-publishable world is the fixture, and each
//! test changes exactly the one fact its rule is named for. A test whose fixture is
//! material for two reasons at once proves neither.

/// it, `commit_supersession` writes it, and `POST …/plans/{planId}/supersessions`

/// real per-currency delta, and `tests/sqlite_supersession_unit.rs` holds both halves:
/// the `thresholdReached` case and the `AutoPublishable` one.
///

/// first). It said `infra::publish::validated_draft_rows` forbids the pair permanently.
/// That function governs what a publish **writes**; the evaluator's **input** is built
/// at `api::rest::publish` from the assembled shape — published *plus* draft — so a plan
/// holding a staged supersession successor **does** present the pair. See **D-200**,
/// **decided 2026-08-06 on option (b)**: the two sets stay different by decision — the
/// evaluator ranges over the candidate set, the commit flips `validated_draft_rows` — so
/// a plan-revision unit's stored verdict can name a row the revision will not publish.
/// What is true without qualification is the output half: no publish ever *flips* a
/// moved row against a published predecessor on one key.
///
/// **And the third correction is that D-200's own ground was false.** *"Over-material
/// and never under-material"* held for `inst-mat-percurrency`, which is the step D-200
/// reasoned about; it does not hold one step over. The staged row is the **only** moved
/// row a plan revision can present, so it is also the only thing that can make
/// `triggers::triggered_by_content`'s `moves_no_row` answer `false` — and with that
/// answer, D-115's whole-revision trigger never fires and a revision whose entire
/// content is the plan's shape auto-publishes. Measured through the router: a €500
/// per-period bound (D-319) published on one principal, `approval: null`,
/// `published_price_ids: []`. `api::rest::publish::materiality_of` now ranges over
/// `infra::publish::unit_row_set` — the candidate set less another unit's staged rows,
/// which is neither of the two options D-200 weighed — and the entry that records the

///
/// So this stays a legitimate unit test of `evaluate` over a **hand-built** input, and

/// `inst-mat-registered` registers *plan-shape revision content* — the descriptor
/// set, the phase graph, the add-on rules, the composites, the plan-change
/// contract and (D-319) the plan-level period floor/cap — as always material. The
/// detector for it is [`triggers::triggered_by_content`], and the detector is
/// **narrower than the rule**: it fires on a change set that moves **no** row, so
/// a change set that moves one is not a shape revision however much shape moved
/// beside it. That is what this case asserts, in the direction the gap runs.
///
/// `ChangeSet` cannot express the difference. Its members are a publish-unit kind,
/// a declared act and a row set; there is no revision, no shape and nothing to
/// diff a shape against, so no argument [`evaluate`] is handed could distinguish
/// *"this revision authored a €500-per-period minimum"* from *"this revision
/// authored nothing"*. Closing it needs a **shape diff against the published
/// revision** — a new operand, moving the five plan-shape facets that predate
/// D-319 as well as its own — and that is a decision, not a fix.
///
/// **What holds the line instead is the caller, and it is named here so a reader
/// of this probe knows what to check.** `api::rest::publish::materiality_of`
/// builds this change set from `infra::publish::unit_row_set`, and the only moved
/// row a plan revision could ever hold — a supersession successor another unit
/// staged on an occupied key — is exactly what that set omits;
/// `infra::publish_tests::the_evaluators_row_set_is_the_set_the_commit_publishes`
/// is the other end of it. With the row in, this route published a period floor
/// on one principal. So a later change that widens the change set again reddens
/// `rest_publish::a_period_bound_published_beside_a_staged_successor_is_still_judged`
/// and lands back here.
///
/// The **positive control** is the second half: the same shape, the same policy,
/// the same baseline, with the moved row taken out answers the trigger. Without it
/// this case would pass against an evaluator that never answered
/// `alwaysMaterialTrigger` at all.
