//! The audit record's canonical, byte-reproducible encoding and its hash link.
//!
//! `pricing_audit_log` is evidence, not a log: D-14 makes tamper-evidence an
//! **in-database hash chain** written inside the mutation's own ACID
//! transaction, so there are no lost records on a crash and an unavailable
//! audit store cannot exist separately from an unavailable database. What makes
//! that chain evidence is that the bytes it hashes are reproducible — a
//! verification job walks a segment years later and recomputes every link, so
//! any encoding this module can produce two ways is a break the job will report
//! that nobody caused.
//!
//! Pure domain: no storage, no `AccessScope`, no I/O. The writer is
//! [`crate::infra::storage::repo::audit_repo`].
//!
//! ## Why the chain is segmented, and what segmentation costs (D-135)
//!
//! A chain is a **strict sequence**: writing row *N* needs row *N-1*'s hash. One
//! chain per tenant therefore serialized **every** audited mutation of that
//! tenant behind a single head, *inside* the mutation transaction — all
//! authoring serialized by construction, against a `>= 50 rows/s` repricing SLO
//! whose per-row cost model never listed the audit write at all. Segmented per
//! `(tenant_id, chain_id)`, where `chain_id` is the audited subject's aggregate
//! (plan, overlay, payer, policy, bulk operation), concurrent mutations of
//! different aggregates proceed independently, while a bulk run's rows — one
//! plan, one `chain_id` — extend sequentially inside that plan's own
//! transaction anyway.
//!
//! What segmentation **costs** is cross-segment evidence: removing a whole
//! segment leaves no gap in any surviving chain. That is restored by a periodic
//! per-tenant **roll-up** row chaining the segment heads — deleting a row breaks
//! its segment, deleting a segment breaks the roll-up. **The roll-up is not
//! written here and is not written anywhere in this gear yet.** It is periodic
//! rather than on the mutation path, and this module deliberately declares no
//! roll-up encoding, so a reader does not go looking for a writer that is
//! absent by design. `chk_pricing_audit_log_rollup` already makes a mutation row
//! carrying segment heads impossible, so nothing written through this encoding
//! can be mistaken for one.
//!
//! ## The genesis seed is bound to the segment, not to the tenant
//!
//! [`genesis_prev_hash`] takes **both** `tenant_id` and `chain_id`. A genesis
//! bound to the tenant alone would give every one of that tenant's segments the
//! same first link, and a whole segment could then be lifted onto another
//! aggregate — same tenant, same seeds, every link still verifying — with
//! nothing in the chain able to tell.
//!
//! ## Two vocabularies, one of them borrowed and one of them ours
//!
//! The migration types `action` and `subject_kind` as free `text` with no
//! `CHECK`, and **no document in the design set declares either vocabulary**.
//! S5 §6 declares a `subject_kind` enumeration for `pricing_approval`
//! (`plan_revision | price_unit | window | overlay | membership | bundle |
//! retirement | policy | bulk_batch` — `historical_import` left it, and the audit
//! half with it, when D-330 struck the import flow) and nothing declares
//! one for `pricing_audit_log`. [`AuditSubjectKind::PlanRevision`] therefore
//! **borrows S5 §6's spelling** for the one value this group writes, so the two
//! stores do not end up naming one thing two ways; the borrowing is recorded
//! here because a token taken from a neighbouring table is one a later document
//! is free to contradict.
//!
//! [`AuditAction::Publish`] is this module's own naming decision, in the
//! `snake_case` shape every other persisted token in this crate uses. It is
//! deliberately **not** `PlanPublished`: that is a frozen *event* name owned by
//! [`CatalogEvent`](crate::domain::events::CatalogEvent), and an audit action
//! spelled the same would be a second home for one string.
//!
//! Only what the crate **writes** is declared. A variant with no writer would
//! read as coverage to everyone who greps for it — D-158's own constraint, and
//! the reason `retire`, `backdate_import` and `policy_update` are absent below
//! though S5 §6 declares them. [`AuditAction::Deny`], [`AuditAction::Approve`]
//! and [`AuditAction::Reject`] each left that list when their writer arrived;
//! see the note at the end of this doc.
//!
//! ## Two of the ten actions are this module's spelling and are **owed to the
//! document**. Reported.
//!
//! `create`, `update` and `delete` are **D-175**'s and are not named here. What
//! this section names is the same gap on the approval plane, found by the same rule
//! and reported the same way.
//!
//! S5 §6's `action` roster is `create | update | delete | publish | abandon |
//! retire | approve | reject | deny | backdate_import | policy_update`, and
//! D-175 clause (2) closes it with **no writer without a token**: every mutating
//! surface this design set specifies carries an `action` there. Two of this
//! slice's surfaces do not.
//!
//! - **[`AuditAction::Submit`]** — the approval unit `POST …/plans/{planId}/publish`
//!   opens on a material change (§4's initial state: *"submitted (opened by a
//!   material change unit … submitter recorded)"*). Its warrant is **`dod-audit`
//!   and nothing wider**: §8's *"**every mutation MUST record**"*, and an insert
//!   into `pricing_approval` is a mutation. That is D-175's own ground, and it is
//!   enough.
//!
//!   **`inst-tp-record` is not a warrant for this token**, and citing it would
//!   overstate the debt. That instruction — *"submitter and approver identities +
//!   timestamps land on the approval record **and in the audit trail**"* — is
//!   assigned by S5 §6 to `approve`/`reject`, whose records satisfy it through
//!   `approval_repo`'s `unit_state` rendering `submitterPrincipal` on both halves of
//!   the pair, with no `submit` token at all. Nor is the submit a *distinct surface*
//!   the roster overlooks: it is the non-committing arm of
//!   `POST …/plans/{planId}/publish`, which the roster names through `publish`.
//! - **[`AuditAction::Withdraw`]** — `POST …/approvals/{approvalId}/withdraw`,
//!   which `inst-as-void` specifies **and calls audited** in as many words. It is
//!   not `reject` (a different edge, by a different authority, with a mandatory
//!   reason) and not `abandon` (D-145's plan-draft flip); the roster has no verb
//!   for it either.
//!
//! Both are **this module's spelling of a record the set requires and does not
//! name**, in the `snake_case` shape D-158 fixes, and both are **reported rather
//! than treated as declared** — D-158's instruction is that "a slice that adds an
//! audited record adds its token **here**", meaning the document, and a code
//! group may not edit one. It is not the same act as minting a wire code: an
//! `action` is a stored discriminator on a vocabulary D-158 makes explicitly
//! **additive**, whose only reader (S12 `inst-he-read`'s Auditor-only sibling)
//! does not exist yet, in a greenfield store — so a document choosing `void` over
//! `withdraw` costs a rename and not a contract change. This is D-175's situation
//! reproduced exactly, and D-175 was ratified on the condition that the debt land
//! in S5 §6 in the next documentation wave.
//!
//! The alternative was to leave the submit and the withdraw writing nothing.
//! That is the state the code-debt register classes *wrong now* rather than
//! *absent*: `pricing_audit_log` is the store D-12 confines to the Auditor, and a
//! withdrawn unit would answer "who withdrew this" with nothing —
//! indistinguishably from "the guard voided it", which is the *other* way a unit
//! reaches `voided` and the one no principal asked for.
//!
//! ## The machine-driven void writes **no** record, and that is a boundary
//!
//! [`AuditAction::Withdraw`] is a **human** act. The TOCTOU guard
//! (`approval_repo::void_pending_for_plan`, `inst-ap-pin`) closes a unit with no
//! principal at all, from inside the transaction of the mutation that
//! invalidated it — and that mutation has already written its own record, on the
//! **same** segment (D-135 keys both on the plan) at the same instant, under the
//! actor who caused it. A second record there would need an actor the act does
//! not have: `actor_principal_id` is a non-null `uuid` precisely because
//! `inst-au-pii` makes the actor a fact rather than a nicety, and a synthetic one
//! would be the trail asserting a principal that did not act.
//!
//! ## The audit **read** surface
//!
//! `inst-au-read` puts the Auditor-only trail behind `audit × read`, paginated
//! per D-125, and [`crate::api::rest::audit`] is it: `GET /bss-pricing/v1/audit`,
//! merged into the gear router, reading the trail through
//! [`crate::infra::audit_read`]. `infra::error_mapping` leans on that route — its
//! `denied` arms drop their detail on the ground that the deny record is
//! readable — so the compensating control is reachable rather than owed, and a
//! second read surface would be a second answer to a question this one already
//! answers. What is still owed of the trail is below.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately absent
//!
//! - **The roll-up encoding and its writer** — see above.
//! - **The verification job** (`pricing_audit_chain_verified`). It walks
//!   segments and the roll-up alike and is off the mutation path by definition;
//!   this module gives it the primitives it will recompute with and nothing
//!   more.
//! - **`backdate_import` and `policy_update`.** S5 §6 declares both and this
//!   gear has no writer for either: there is no `pricing_historical_price` store
//!   (`inst-bd-store`) and no threshold-policy store (D-10). A token declared
//!   here with no writer is indistinguishable from a record nobody writes, so
//!   they stay owed.
//!
//!   **`retire` is not among them**: S5 §6 declares it and
//!   `crate::infra::retirement` writes it, inside the flip's own transaction
//!   (D-128, Slice 11).
//!
//!   **`migrate` is not either, and is minted rather than inherited.** It comes
//!   from Slice 11's migration plane rather than S5 §6's list, so the
//!   one-token-one-writer rule is satisfied by construction:
//!   `crate::infra::migration` writes it inside the schedule's and the cancel's
//!   own transactions. S5 §6 enumerates `migrate` as an **authz action** on the
//!   `plan` resource; whether its audit-token list should name it too is in the
//!   Slice 11 hand-back's documentation register, because that list is `docs/`
//!   and not this module's to extend.
//!
//! `approve`, `reject` and `deny` **are** declared, and each has its writer:
//! `pricing_approval` holds the records, a plan-revision subject's chain is the
//! plan's by D-135, `crate::infra::storage::repo::approval_repo` takes the stamp
//! and writes the decision's record inside the deciding transaction, and
//! `crate::infra::approval::decide` writes the refused attempt's. The rule is not
//! "declare nothing until everything is built"; it is one token, one writer,
//! landing together.
