//! The approval record's state machine — `cpt-cf-bss-pricing-state-approval`
//! (`design/05-governance.md` §4).
//!
//! [`ApprovalState::transition`] is the single source of truth for what is
//! legal, in the shape [`crate::domain::lifecycle::LifecycleState`] already has
//! and for the same reason: the `pricing_approval` trigger and the REST surface
//! both restate the machine in their own vocabulary, and if the legal edge set
//! lived in three places the one that drifted would be discovered as an approval
//! that decided twice.
//!
//! Legal edges, and nothing else:
//!
//! ```text
//! submitted -> approved     (inst-as-approve)
//! submitted -> rejected     (inst-as-reject)
//! submitted -> voided       (inst-as-void)
//! ```
//!
//! Everything else is refused, including every self-edge and every move out of
//! a decided state (`inst-as-immutable`). There is no re-open and no re-submit
//! **of a record**: §4 says a re-submit opens a *new* one, which is what keeps
//! `content_hash` a pin rather than a field.
//!
//! # The function is total, and it returns a reason rather than a bool
//!
//! A predicate answering `false` makes every refused edge the same event, and
//! two of the edges here are not the same event at all. Deciding an
//! already-decided or voided record is `APPROVAL_NOT_PENDING` (§5, 409) — a
//! caller raced another decision, or is acting on a stale list. Asking a
//! `submitted` record to stay `submitted` is a caller bug no surface can commit.
//! [`TransitionRefusal`] keeps them apart, and [`TransitionRefusal::code`]
//! answers `None` for the second.
//!
//! **`None` is deliberate and is not an omission.** The approve, reject and
//! withdraw routes each name a fixed outcome, so no request can ask for the
//! self-edge; minting a code for it would document an API a client cannot
//! provoke, which is the argument D-146 makes about the pin frontier's
//! regression and the reason that one carries no code either.
//! [`ApprovalDecision`] makes the same point in the type system — the outcome a
//! surface can ask for is one of three, and the self-edge is unrepresentable on
//! that path.
//!
//! **That argument was not true when it was first written**, and the correction
//! is worth keeping: `ApprovalDecision` had no caller at all, while
//! [`approval_repo::decide`](crate::infra::storage::repo::approval_repo::decide)
//! took a bare [`ApprovalState`] and folded every refusal into
//! `APPROVAL_NOT_PENDING`. So the one path into the store *could* ask a pending
//! record to stay pending, and was answered "approval X is submitted; only a
//! submitted record is decidable" — a 409 contradicting itself, for a refusal
//! this module had argued no client could provoke. The repository now takes the
//! decision, which is what makes the sentence above a fact about the code rather
//! than about an unused type. `approval_tests::no_decision_is_ever_refused_as_not_an_outcome`
//! ranges over the whole state x decision product and is what keeps it one.
//!
//! # What this file carries, and what its siblings do
//!
//! This file is the state machine and nothing else: it needs only the record's
//! own state, while the two-person rule's `submitter != approver` comparison,
//! the content pin, the approver's scope check and the materiality evaluator
//! each need a *subject* — a `PlanShape`, an authz claim set, a change set. A
//! state machine that reached for a plan would have to be re-stated by every
//! other subject `subject_kind` admits.
//!
//! They land beside it, as this module's earlier note said they would:
//!
//! - [`content_pin`] — `inst-ap-pin`'s digest over the submitted plan revision.
//! - [`decision`] — the whole decision-refusal vocabulary ([`DecisionRefusal`])
//!   and the pure judgement [`authorize_decision`], covering the two-person
//!   rule, the approver's scope, the mandatory reason and the pin's
//!   re-verification.
//!
//! Both are re-exported here, so `domain::approval::content_hash` and
//! `domain::approval::DecisionRefusal` are the names a surface reaches for. The
//! four wire codes `decision.rs` declares are re-exported beside them for the
//! same reason and one more: [`APPROVAL_NOT_PENDING`] already lives here, and a
//! consumer-visible vocabulary split across two paths is one a reader has to
//! know is split.
//!
//! The materiality evaluator is [`crate::domain::materiality`] — a fourth
//! subject, a change set, and therefore its own module for the reason above. It
//! carries §3's three fail-safe arms and, deliberately, none of its threshold
//! comparison; its module doc says why, and what the group that adds one owes.
