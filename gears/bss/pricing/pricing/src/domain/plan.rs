//! The plan aggregate as the domain reasons about it: **one revision of it**,
//! and the fields an open draft may still move.
//!
//! A plan is not a row. It is a chain of revisions keyed `(plan_id, revision)`
//! (`design/01-foundation.md` §3.7 and §4.3, D-56) of which at most one is the
//! **current** one — `published` *or* `retired`, widened by D-128 — and at most
//! one is an open `draft`. The type below is named for the revision rather than
//! for the plan on purpose: a `Plan` type would invite exactly the read D-56
//! removed, "the plan's billing cycle", as though one answer existed
//! independently of which revision is being asked about. Every value here
//! answers *for its revision*.
//!
//! Content freezes at `published` (§4.3): a shape change opens a **new**
//! revision row in `draft`, which publishes through the standard §4.2 path and
//! flips its predecessor `superseded` in the same commit (D-90). That is why
//! [`PlanShapePatch`] is the mutable surface of an *open draft* and not of a
//! plan — there is no edit of a published revision for it to describe.
//!
//! A draft that is not wanted is **abandoned**, never deleted: the row survives
//! as a terminal tombstone so the `revision` number it consumed stays consumed
//! (D-145). What that costs is a gap in the numbering; what it buys is that
//! `(plan_id, revision)` never names two different rows.
//!
//! The child shape tables — phases, add-on rules, descriptor set — version with
//! the revision and are copied on a new one (D-83); they are Slice-2 storage and
//! are not modelled here yet.

/// * [`PlanShapePatch::frequency`] moves **three** columns as one value.
