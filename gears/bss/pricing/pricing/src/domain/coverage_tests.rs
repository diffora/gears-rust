//! What the coverage rules refuse, and the worlds in which each refusal is the
//! thing that answers.
//!
//! Every instant here is a **fixed** one — `at(day)` is 2026-09-01 plus a whole
//! number of days — and none of these rules reads a clock: the coverage walk is
//! pure over an interval set, so no case can start passing or failing because
//! today's date moved past it.
//!
//! The pipeline under test is [`window_coverage_rules`], Slice 7's own set,
//! rather than `run_publish_rules`. The aggregate's *registration* of this set is
//! a separate fact with its own test in `publish/rules_tests.rs`, because a test
//! that ran the aggregate would redden both when a rule is wrong and when the
//! registration is missing, and those are two defects with two different fixes.
