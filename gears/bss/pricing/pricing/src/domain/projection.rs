//! What a `CatalogVersion` freezes for one **plan subject** — the value, and
//! the payload it renders into `pricing_read_model.payload`.
//!
//! A version's rows are per-subject deltas (D-86, subject-typed by D-91), and
//! this module is the `plan` kind's content: the plan's current revision, its
//! revision-scoped children (D-83) and the price rows the version publishes.
//! Pure vocabulary and rendering — no storage, no scope, no I/O. The projector
//! that reads truth rows and writes this value lives in
//! [`crate::infra::read_model`], because it holds an `AccessScope` and
//! repositories and dylint DE0301 forbids those here.
//!
//! # No document declares this payload's field list. **Reported.**
//!
//! `01-foundation.md` §4.4 states what a plan-subject delta must *carry* — the
//! window facts (D-121) and the revision's `lifecycle_state`, which is what
//! sellability predicate (4) reads at the pin (D-128) — and §3.7 states how the
//! row is *keyed*. Neither names a schema, and §3.1's one-line sketch of the
//! `ReadModel` aggregate (`{skuId, planId, priceId}`, model kind, ordered tier
//! bands, evaluation-policy fields, descriptors) is a sketch. The wire keys
//! below are therefore **this module's**, written down once so a later document
//! has something concrete to contradict — exactly the posture
//! [`outbox_repo`](crate::infra::storage::repo::outbox_repo) took for
//! `PlanPublished`, and for the same reason.
//!
//! They are `camelCase`, the spelling the design set uses for consumer-visible
//! fields (`pricingSnapshotRef`, `planId`, `availableFrom`), and they are built
//! with `json!` rather than a `Serialize` derive so the wire vocabulary is
//! visibly not the Rust field names and lives in exactly one place.
//!
//! # What this payload does not carry, and whose it is
//!
//! A version this gear produces today is **incomplete against §4.4**, and the
//! incompleteness is declared here rather than left for a reader to discover.
//! One line per absent fact, with the slice that owns it:
//!
//! - ~~**`PriceWindow` intervals and states, and the derived coverage end**~~ —
//!   **landed 2026-08-04 and struck from this list.** [`PlanSubjectDelta::windows`]
//!   carries them, grouped per canonical scope key, so a version this module
//!   renders **does** answer sellability predicate (1) — "an active window covers
//!   `t` with the D-80 coverage horizon" (`07-pricewindow-linkage.md`
//!   `inst-sg-surface`) — from the pin, which is what `inst-sg-pinned` requires of
//!   it. The line is struck rather than deleted because `inst-sg-pinned`'s
//!   arithmetic is stated against this list: it says a version projected before
//!   these facts exist answers **three of six**, and with predicate (1)'s operand
//!   present that becomes **four of six**. The D-121 **horizon** `H` is still
//!   absent, for a different reason than this fact was, and its own premise is
//!   stated where the projector applies it.
//! - **The GA-gate flags** `not_sellable_ga` and the prepaid-execution gate
//!   (Slice 4 / Slice 10) — sellability predicate (5). Neither has a store
//!   here.
//! - **The registry `sellable` flag** per offered SKU (D-46) — predicate (6).
//!   It is the registry's fact, frozen per version registry-side, and the
//!   registry gear has no code in this repository.
//! - ~~**The grant set and the materialized phase-to-grant map** (Slice 6,
//!   D-41)~~ — **landed 2026-08-07 and struck.** [`PlanSubjectDelta::entitlement_grants`]
//!   carries the authored set and `phaseGrantMap` carries the complete map, so a
//!   consumer resolves the active phase at `t` by one lookup.
//!
//!   The struck line also named the wrong store, and the correction matters more
//!   than the strike: it said *"`pricing_plan_grant` does not exist here"*, but
//!   that table is **Slice 10's** (D-52) and holds D-43's prepaid **credit**
//!   grant — a different object with a different lifecycle. The Slice-6
//!   entitlement grant set is a column, `pricing_plan.entitlement_grants`
//!   (`m20260802_000053`), which is what its own §6 declares. A reader who took
//!   the old line at face value would have built a Slice-6 requirement inside a
//!   Slice-10 aggregate.
//!
//! The Slice-6 **cross-boundary contract** was on that list as an unstampable
//! pair and is not on it any more: [`CROSS_BOUNDARY_CHANGE_POLICY`] is stamped on
//! every resolved plan subject, and its former other half is not a field at all
//! — see that constant's own doc for why.
//!
//! # What it carries and **should not**: two Slice-10 primitives nothing judges
//!
//! [`row_value`] renders `tierQualificationWindow` and `includedAllowance` into
//! the delta, and **Slice 10 has landed nothing else**: not one of the ten
//! refusals `inst-ac-gate` / `inst-tt-forbidden` / `inst-tt-window-pair` /
//! `inst-tt-zero-band` / `inst-tt-fixture` state, and not the allowance compile
//! that gives the declaration its meaning. A version this module projects
//! therefore freezes, into an INSERT-only store on the ≥ 7-year truth horizon, two
//! fields no rule in this gear has judged and no compiler has honoured — and
//! rating would bill an accepted allowance from the first unit.
//!
//! **It is not reachable today and it is one route away.** What holds the line is
//! a single refusal at a single surface —
//! `api::rest::prices::refuse_unlanded_primitives`, on the only two mounted routes
//! that can carry either field — plus the fact that
//! `POST …/plans/{planId}/publish` is **not mounted**, so nothing calls
//! `PublishService::commit` and nothing calls this module on a production path.
//! Mount that route and the freeze is live **with no further code change and no
//! gate that would notice**.
//!
//! Both fields also sit in the `ep-2` roster
//! ([`crate::domain::evaluation_policy`]), which says the opposite of a warning:
//! it tells a consumer both are part of the field set an evaluator reads.
//!
//! **Whoever mounts the publish route, or adds a second writer of a `PriceRow`,
//! owes either the ten Slice-10 refusals or a refusal at their own boundary.**
//! Deleting the two fields from this renderer is *not* the fix — D-129's
//! supersession guard compares them between a predecessor and a successor, and a
//! delta that dropped them would lose a field that guard reads.
//!
//! No DTO in this gear sets `deny_unknown_fields`, so the surface refusal is also
//! contingent on both members remaining **modelled** fields rather than silently
//! ignored ones (D-174 clause 1) — a second reason the warning belongs here, next
//! to the renderer, rather than only at the boundary that refuses them.
//!
//! One absence is a **rule** rather than a gap, and it is listed so a later
//! reader does not close it: the operator-plane drift flags
//! (`tier_divergent`, `grants_divergent`, the tax-readiness and meter-binding
//! divergences) are **never** part of a frozen version (D-85). They live in
//! `pricing_operator_flag` and operators read them through the authoring
//! surfaces. A version that carried one would be a frozen artifact whose
//! content changes when an external signal arrives.
//!
//! **No payload-generation marker is invented for any of this.** The gear has
//! exactly one such mechanism — the evaluation-policy generation
//! ([`EVALUATION_POLICY_GENERATION`], D-162) — with a declared roster, a
//! declared bump rule and a replayed log, and it qualifies the **price row's
//! evaluation field set**, not the delta's shape. Stretching it to mean "this
//! payload is missing Slice 7" is the same act as minting a code the design set
//! does not name.
//!
//! # The D-162 obligation, discharged
//!
//! D-162 records one hole against the implementation: `usageCounterOnPlanChange`
//! (D-113) "is an evaluation input outside the roster only because the plan-content
//! type it would be classified against does not exist in the crate yet, and the
//! slice landing it joins the roster under a bump". [`PlanSubjectDelta`] **is**
//! that plan-content type, so the walk is owed here and is done here.
//!
//! The boundary is D-162's own: a field is rostered **iff it tells an evaluator
//! how to derive the billable quantity or select the rate**. Field by field —
//! `plan_id`, `revision` and `sku_id` are identity; `lifecycle_state`,
//! `available_from` and `available_to` are sellability inputs (predicates (3)
//! and (4)), which decide *whether* a thing may be sold and never *at what
//! rate*; `billing_cycle` and `frequency` name the period a subscription's
//! cycle clock runs on, which `01-foundation.md` §4.4 puts in the
//! consumer-contract family D-162 excludes by name (proration, anchoring,
//! billing timing) and which no evaluator reads to derive a quantity — the
//! quantity-derivation fields are the row's own `billing_granularity` and
//! `aggregation_*`, already rostered; `plan_tier` and `plan_tier_override` are
//! the registry taxonomy and its audited divergence; the purchase bounds gate a
//! purchase, not a rate; `invoice_grouping_key` is a Billing layout hint (D-96);
//! the phase set, the add-on rules and the descriptor set are composition and
//! presentation. **None of them is rostered, so the roster does not move and
//! `ep-2` stands.**
//!
//! D-162's named example **is landed now** (Slice 6, 2026-08-07), and the
//! paragraph that said it "does not exist in this crate — there is no column, no
//! field and no writer for it anywhere" is corrected rather than deleted,
//! because a premise resting on a fact that has changed is one a later reader
//! will believe for the wrong reason. `usage_counter_on_plan_change` is a column
//! (`m20260802_000052`), a field of [`PlanChangeContract`], written by
//! `plan_repo` and rendered into this payload as `usageCounterOnPlanChange`.
//!
//! **The bump D-162 owed is made: the generation is `ep-2`** (main session,
//! 2026-08-07, on the register item this strand handed back). The document's log
//! gained `ep-2  D-113  + usage_counter_on_plan_change`, and
//! [`EVALUATION_POLICY_GENERATION`] followed it rather than the other way round —
//! D-162 clause (5) makes the roster *what replaying that log produces*, and
//! [`evaluation_policy_tests`](crate::domain::evaluation_policy) reads the block
//! with `include_str!`.
//!
//! **It cost more than a line, and the reason is the hazard this paragraph used
//! to describe.** The guard's exhaustive classification ran over
//! [`PriceRow`](crate::domain::price_row::PriceRow) alone, so a plan-scoped
//! roster member was invisible to it — exactly what D-162 warns of: *"a slice
//! that lands it and leaves the roster alone leaves the generation claiming more
//! than it covers."* Appending the log line therefore made the document's roster
//! disagree with the crate's, which is the test failing **as designed**. The
//! mechanism was widened instead of the document being trimmed to fit it:
//! `partition_plan_fields` is a second exhaustive destructure over
//! [`PlanChangeContract`], the roster is the **union** of the two, and each
//! struct keeps its own arm — because a pattern that misses a new field must
//! fail to compile, and one pattern cannot span two structs.
//!
//! The D-162 guard's **reach** is decided here too, and it stays where it is.
//! [`partition_row_fields`](crate::domain::evaluation_policy::partition_row_fields)
//! keeps `PriceRow` alone, because §4.4's roster block is a set of
//! **`pricing_price`** fields by its own words and its `outside:` half
//! enumerates `pricing_price` columns; a second partition over this type would
//! have to be asserted against a document block that does not exist, and an
//! expectation invented to satisfy a guard is the guard switched off. What this
//! type gets instead is a guard with a real obligation: [`PlanSubjectDelta::to_value`]
//! destructures with **no rest pattern**, so a field added to the delta is a
//! compile error until it is either rendered into the payload or deliberately
//! withheld — and that is where the next author meets the D-162 question, with
//! this paragraph beside it.
