//! The row lifecycle state machine.
//!
//! [`LifecycleState::transition`] is the **single source of truth** for what is
//! legal. The database trigger's column whitelist and the authoring surfaces
//! both restate the machine in their own vocabulary; if the legal edge set
//! lived in three places, the one that drifted would be discovered as a
//! published row in a state nothing can move it out of.
//!
//! Legal edges, and nothing else:
//!
//! ```text
//! draft      -> published
//! draft      -> abandoned
//! published  -> superseded
//! published  -> retired
//! ```
//!
//! `draft -> abandoned` is how a revision is **discarded**, and it exists
//! because the obvious alternative does not survive the key (D-145). Deleting
//! the row frees its `revision`, `(plan_id, revision)` is a durable name — the
//! grant table is keyed by it, every revision-scoped child copies under it, the
//! audit trail records it — and the next draft mints the number again. A client
//! holding the discarded `plan/2`'s row version then submits against the *new*
//! `plan/2` and its precondition **passes**, most reachably at the initial
//! version every freshly minted revision carries: a lost update arriving through
//! the key instead of the version.
//!
//! `published -> superseded` has exactly **two** sanctioned producers: the
//! supersession unit, and the grandfathering cutover commit (D-100) whose
//! `all_subscriptions` successor lands on the predecessor's own key. Both set
//! `supersedes_price_id` on the successor, which is what gives the unit guard
//! its comparison referent (D-127). No third path may produce this flip.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no self-edge**: re-publishing a published row is not
//! a no-op, it is a request whose intent the machine cannot infer, and treating
//! it as one would let a retry silently pass through the same guard twice.
