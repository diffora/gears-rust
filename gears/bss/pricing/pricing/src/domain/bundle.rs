//! Bundle composition's vocabulary, and the `RevShareReconciler` of
//! `design/08-bundles.md` `inst-rs-residual` (D-07) and `inst-rs-sum` (D-55).
//!
//! # The reconciler is the whole of D-07, and it is arithmetic
//!
//! Operators author percentages that come from contracts — 33.33%, three ways —
//! and three of those are 9999 basis points. D-07 accepts that: authoring is
//! tolerant to `|Σ(share_bp) + platform_cut_bp − 10000| ≤ 1 bp`, and **publish
//! normalizes** the group's nominated absorber so the published effective shares
//! sum to exactly 10000. The typed values stay beside the effective ones for
//! audit, which is why `pricing_bundle_revshare` carries two columns and not one
//! rewritten in place.
//!
//! Everything here is per **group** — one `(bundle, vendor SKU)` — because that
//! is the scope D-55 re-typed the rule onto: *"sum to 100% **per** included
//! vendor SKU"*. A reconciler ranging over a bundle would be answering a question
//! nobody asks.
//!
//! # Two refusals, and only one of them has a code of its own
//!
//! `RESIDUAL_OVER_TOLERANCE` is D-07's, declared in §5, and it is what a residual
//! over 1 bp gets — the six-way even split (6 × 1666 = 9996) that decision names
//! as the case an operator must reconcile by hand.
//!
//! `REVSHARE_UNBALANCED` is §5's code for *structural* malformation, and it is
//! what the other three refusals render under: a group with no party rows at all
//! (the shares are the allocation base, and a platform cut alone is not a split),
//! an absorber naming a party the group does not hold, and a normalization that
//! would push the absorber off the 0…10000 scale. **None of those three has a
//! code of its own in §5**, and a gear may mint `RepoError`/`DomainError`
//! variants freely while a wire code is the design set's to declare — so they
//! render under the existing one and the gap is written into the owed register
//! (B-5). The reading is not a stretch: in each case no member of the group can
//! take the residual, so the group cannot be made to sum to 10000, which is
//! exactly what "structurally malformed shares" describes.
//!
//! # The platform absorbs on its **cut**, a party absorbs on its **share**
//!
//! D-07 says "the group's `residual_absorber_party` has its **effective** share
//! adjusted", and for the platform sentinel that value is `platform_cut_bp` —
//! the platform holds no party row, by construction. Both are reported, so a
//! caller writing the normalization back never has to decide which column moved.
