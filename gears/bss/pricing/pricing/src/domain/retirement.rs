//! Retirement's compose-time judgement (`inst-rt-cancel`, `inst-re-cancelflow`,
//! `inst-re-references`, D-51, D-131, D-182).
//!
//! Retirement stops **selling**, never **rating**. Everything in this module
//! follows from that one sentence: not-sellable comes from the lifecycle
//! predicate of the sellability gate (`domain::sellability` predicate (4)), so
//! nothing here has to cancel a window in order to stop a sale, and every window
//! it *does* cancel it cancels for a different reason — an unoccupied key's
//! scheduled window is coverage nobody is going to use.
//!
//! # The presence question is asked once, and answered per price id
//!
//! D-131. Retirement submits the **union** of its keys' price-id sets in a single
//! call on the D-79 in-flight-subscription lane and reads a **per-price-id
//! presence map** back. The two alternatives it was chosen over are both wrong in
//! ways worth keeping written down: a lane that answers a *count* over the
//! submitted set answers only "does this plan have any subscriber at all", under
//! which retirement cancels nothing whenever a single key is occupied; and a
//! per-key call puts N synchronous cross-gear round trips (N = keys × markets)
//! inside the retirement transaction, holding the price and window row locks and
//! the audit chain segment across the fan-out.
//!
//! # The lane is absent, so every key reads occupied
//!
//! D-182, normative. The D-79 lane has no client, no contract type and no
//! counterpart gear in the built system. D-131's outage clause is fail-closed —
//! on lane outage or timeout, **windows are kept** — and D-182 makes an absent
//! lane that same case. So in the system as built [`PresenceMap::fail_closed`] is
//! the only value this module is ever handed, every key reads occupied, and
//! retirement keeps every scheduled window rather than cancelling on the keys the
//! design set would have let it cancel on.
//!
//! That is not a stub standing in for the rule: it *is* the rule, evaluated
//! against the world as it is. [`dispose_windows`] is written against the map and
//! not against its absence, so the day the lane client lands a
//! [`PresenceMap::resolved`] flows through the same code and the presence half of
//! `inst-rt-cancel` becomes what that step describes.
//!
//! **The presence predicate is not the only thing that decides a scheduled
//! window's fate** (D-316), and reading it as though it were is the error three
//! surfaces have carried at once — here, [`crate::infra::retirement`]'s call site
//! and `inst-rt-cancel`'s own normative prose. D-04's `inst-co-bounds` binds a
//! grandfathered generation's coverage across a span, retirement's cancellations
//! reach the window store without passing `infra::window`'s enforcement of it, and
//! a generation reading *unoccupied* is precisely the case the presence lane waves
//! through. [`strand_free_disposition`] is the edit that answers it.
//!
//! # Two questions, two populations, and neither subsumes the other
//!
//! `dispose_windows` asks *who is bound to this row now*. The bound asks *what
//! must this generation still cover*. They are asked in that order and the second
//! only ever moves a verdict from cancelled back to kept, so the presence lane
//! keeps its full authority to **keep** and loses only its authority to cancel
//! something D-04 has spoken for.
//!
//! # Kept is not the same fact as cancelled, and the operator sees both
//!
//! `inst-re-cancelflow` requires the confirm screen to label kept windows
//! distinctly from cancelled ones, which is why [`WindowDisposition`] carries a
//! reason rather than a bool: an operator who is shown "3 windows" cannot tell a
//! plan whose coverage is being preserved from one whose coverage is being torn
//! down.
