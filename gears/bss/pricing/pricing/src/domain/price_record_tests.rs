//! What the record model has to keep true independently of storage.
//!
//! Every field of `PriceRecord` is exercised end to end in
//! `tests/sqlite_price_repo.rs`, where a mapping that dropped or transposed a
//! column actually fails; its lifecycle predicate belongs to `LifecycleState`,
//! which `lifecycle_tests.rs` already covers for all four states. What is left is
//! the split between the record and the content, which is a decision rather than
//! a derive — and `authored_content`'s rewrites, which are what every caller that
//! **judges or compares** a row without a store in front of it relies on
//! (`domain::import`'s Phase 1 has no store at all).
