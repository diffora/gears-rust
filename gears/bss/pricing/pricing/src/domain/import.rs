//! Bulk import, Phase 1 — the checks that need no store
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §3 `algo-bulk-import` `inst-bk-phase1`,
//! §4 `inst-bi-validate`; D-118, D-148).
//!
//! # Why a Phase 1 at all, and why part of it lives here
//!
//! `inst-bk-phase1` is **validate all-or-nothing**: one invalid row blocks the
//! whole batch pre-commit, with a per-row report naming every violation. That
//! posture only pays for itself if the report is complete — an operator fixing a
//! batch one refusal at a time is doing what the all-or-nothing rule exists to
//! spare them — so a rule that can answer for a row **must** answer for every row
//! rather than stopping at the first.
//!
//! Phase 1's rules split by what they need. Some need the store: whether the row
//! addresses a **published** scope key (`IMPORT_TARGETS_PUBLISHED`, D-118),
//! whether its key holds a pending approval unit (D-35), whether its `If-Match`
//! is current. Others need only the batch, and those are here. Keeping them apart
//! is not tidiness: the batch-only rules are the ones a caller can run before it
//! has opened anything, and they are the ones whose behaviour a test can state
//! without building a world.
//!
//! # The in-batch duplicate, and the key it is judged on (D-148)
//!
//! Two rows on one canonical scope key are a duplicate **inside** the batch and
//! fail Phase 1 per-row. The key is the **whole** [`ScopeKey`], usage line
//! included, which is the column list of `uq_pricing_price_scope_key_draft` as
//! `m20260802_000023` **widened** it: `COALESCE(meter, '')` and `dimension_key`
//! are in the index, so two rows differing only in their usage line are two
//! keys and both author.
//!
//! The index also carries `tenant_id`, which [`ScopeKey`] does not, so this rule
//! is **stricter than the index by one column** — harmless because a bulk
//! operation carries one tenant (`pricing_bulk_operation` has a `tenant_id` and
//! no `plan_id`, so a run is single-tenant and may span plans). That premise is
//! written here rather than left implicit, an unstated premise about the schema
//! being exactly how the first version of this rule went wrong.
//!
//! **This was got wrong once and the wrong answer is worth keeping visible**
//! (D-283). The first build read `m20260802_000002`, which created the index in
//! its original eight-axis form, and judged the duplicate on those eight — so it
//! refused a batch the store admits, and the batch it refused was D-103's
//! confirmed worked example, a `PaaS` plan pricing cloudlets, storage and egress.
//! D-196 made the usage pair normative axes of the canonical key precisely to
//! make that plan expressible. **Read the schema, not a migration**: a `CREATE
//! INDEX` is a statement about the day it ran.
//!
//! # Both sides of a duplicate are named
//!
//! A collision has two rows in it and neither is more at fault than the other:
//! the operator has to see both to decide which one they meant. Reporting only
//! the second would also make the report depend on the order the rows arrived in,
//! which is not a property of the batch.
