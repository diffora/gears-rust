//! The published read model's subject vocabulary.
//!
//! A version's rows are **per-subject deltas** and never a full tenant copy
//! (D-86, subject-typed by D-91): a version contains exactly the subjects of
//! the publish units that produced it. The reason is arithmetic, not taste —
//! interactive publishes coalesce on a 5-second SLO, and a full tenant copy per
//! version would multiply a tenant's whole catalog by its publish rate. It is
//! also what makes an old pin resolvable: resolving `(pin, subject)` reads that
//! subject's greatest completed version at or below the pin, so a version that
//! touched nothing of a subject costs nothing and hides nothing.
//!
//! The per-delta *size* is bounded separately by the D-121 projected-set
//! horizon, so a plan delta carries the rows and windows intersecting the
//! horizon rather than the plan's whole accumulated history.
