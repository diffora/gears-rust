//! Regenerates the joint corpus's `registry.toml`.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run -p bss-pricing --example regen_registry`
//!
//! **An example target, not a binary of either crate, and that is the design.**
//! The registry records two independently earned halves: `oracle`, which only
//! `bss-fixtures-conformance` can run, and `publish`, which only this gear's
//! validator can run. Neither crate may take the other as a normal dependency —
//! the corpus's invariant is that no evaluator reaches a gear even transitively,
//! which is why the harness is a dev-dependency here. An example compiles with
//! dev-dependencies, so this is the one build in which both halves are visible,
//! and therefore the one place that can write the file.
//!
//! The freshness assertion lives beside it in `tests/corpus_publish.rs`. There
//! is exactly **one** authority on the file's content: two crates each asserting
//! a different expectation is how a generated file starts flapping.
//!
//! Commit a regeneration on its own.
