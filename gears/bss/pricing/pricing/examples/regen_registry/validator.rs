//! The gear's [`PublishValidator`]: what this catalog answers when the corpus
//! asks what publish does with an authored successor.
//!
//! Deliberately **not** part of the library. It compiles only into the
//! `regen_registry` example and the `corpus_publish` test, both of which build
//! with dev-dependencies, so `bss-fixtures-conformance` never becomes a
//! production edge of the gear — the corpus's stated invariant is that no
//! evaluator reaches a gear even transitively.
//!
//! ## Shape first, then the pair
//!
//! [`CatalogPublishValidator::validate`] runs the successor's **row-shape**
//! rules ([`price_row_rules`]) before the **supersession unit guard**
//! ([`supersession_rules`]), and reports the first violation of that order.
//!
//! The order is not a preference. A malformed row is malformed regardless of
//! what it supersedes: a `graduated` row with a closed top band prices a
//! quantity nobody can be billed for whether it lands on an occupied key or on
//! an empty one. The pair guard, by contrast, is a **comparison** — it only has
//! meaning once both sides are rows the catalog would have accepted on their
//! own. Asking "did this successor change the unit?" of a row that is not a
//! publishable row at all answers a question about a hypothetical.
//!
//! It is also what the gear does at publish time: the row-local pipeline is
//! registered once (D-21) and runs at save and again inside the publish commit;
//! the pair guard runs only where a predecessor exists.
//!
//! ## What "cannot be assessed" means
//!
//! [`EvalError`] is reserved for a snapshot the gear's row shape cannot hold —
//! a value outside a gear enum's vocabulary, or a field belonging to a slice
//! this gear has not built. A **rejection by the rules under test is a verdict**,
//! not an error: that is the case doing its job.
//!
//! `currency` is the one snapshot field read and then dropped without either.
//! It is a **scope-key axis**, not a row field ([`PriceRow`] carries no
//! currency, on purpose — pairing one into the amount would create a second
//! place to disagree about what a row is priced in), so no shape rule consumes
//! it and no rejection can turn on it.
