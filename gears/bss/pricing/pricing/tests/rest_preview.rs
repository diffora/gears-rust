//! `inst-mc-nofx` is the slice's sharpest sentence — *"No FX derivation ever … no
//! base-currency fallback"* — and the way an implementation gets it wrong is not
//! by writing an FX call, it is by answering *something* for a market it has no
//! row on: the nearest currency, the same currency in another region, or an empty
//! 200. Each of those is a case here, and each is asserted to be a **404**.
//!
//! The positive control comes first regardless, because a preview that answered
//! 404 to everything would satisfy every one of them.
