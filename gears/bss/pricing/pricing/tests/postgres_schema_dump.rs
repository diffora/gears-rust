//! The Postgres half of the schema oracle.
//!
//! The same three properties its `SQLite` sibling establishes — deterministic, complete, and
//! honest about what it normalises — plus the golden the re-authoring is checked against. See
//! `sqlite_schema_dump.rs` for the argument; this file only states what differs on this engine.
//!
//! **What differs.** Postgres re-renders constraints and indexes from their parsed form, so
//! `pg_get_constraintdef` returns the server's canonical spelling rather than the submitted text.
//! A re-authored migration that writes the same rule differently therefore compares equal here on
//! the server's own authority, which is a stronger guarantee than the `SQLite` side can give. The
//! dump also carries functions, which `SQLite` has none of, and `EXCLUDE` constraints, which
//! `SQLite` expresses as trigger pairs.
//!
//! Task 2 of `tasks/plan.md`.
