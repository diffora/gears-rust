//! The activation/expiry sweep against the executed `SQLite` mirror.
//!
//! `WindowActivationJob` is a statement about rows in two tables at once —
//! `pricing_price_window` and `pricing_outbox` — and about what one transaction
//! does to them together. A unit test over the job could assert that it calls
//! the store; it could not assert that a second pass over the same instant flips
//! nothing, that an open-ended window is never picked up, or that one plan's
//! events come back sequenced. So the sweep's behaviour lives here and
//! `src/infra/jobs/window_activation_tests.rs` keeps only what needs no
//! database, which is the split
//! `readmodel_warm.rs` / `tests/sqlite_read_model.rs` established.
//!
//! # Instants are the caller's, and that is what makes them facts
//!
//! [`WindowActivationJob::run`] takes `now`, so every "past" and "future" in
//! this file is a relation between two values this file supplies — not between a
//! fixture and the wall clock. The window instants are nevertheless in **2099**,
//! for `tests/sqlite_window_repo.rs`'s reason: the mirror's fifth trigger arm
//! compares an `effective_to` against `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, so a suite that ever
//! grows an `effectiveTo` adjustment inherits a fixture that would start failing
//! on a date rather than on a defect.
//!
//! # The one place the *text* of an instant matters
//!
//! [`a_boundary_earlier_the_same_day_is_due`] exists because the mirror stores
//! `timestamptz` as `text`: a due predicate rendered on one side and stored on
//! the other in different shapes compares lexicographically, and the two shapes
//! agree on the date and disagree at byte 11 — which is how a whole arm of this
//! chain once read every instant on today's UTC date as being in the future. A
//! comparison across a date boundary cannot see that; one inside a single day
//! can.
