//! `pricing_approval`'s constraints and triggers, proved by **executing the
//! statement each of them must refuse**, on Postgres.
//!
//! `tests/postgres_migrations.rs` says the objects reached the server; it issues
//! no DML and is therefore evidence of presence only. This suite is the other
//! half for one table: every CHECK and every branch of
//! `bss.pricing_approval_append_only()` answers a statement written to trip it,
//! and the assertion names the object the answer came from. A suite that wrote
//! only valid rows would catch a constraint that got *narrower* and never one
//! that stopped refusing — the defect class that let fourteen `pricing_price`
//! CHECKs each be replaceable with `CHECK (1 = 1)` with the whole crate green.
//!
//! Two rules every test here follows, both from `postgres_migrations.rs`'s
//! module doc:
//!
//! **Put the world in the state where the object under test is what answers.**
//! A refusal an earlier guard produces is not evidence about the guard the test
//! names — which is why the trigger cases seed a valid row first and the CHECK
//! cases vary exactly one column of an otherwise-valid row.
//!
//! **Every guard must be provable by removal.** Drop the constraint or the
//! trigger branch, watch *exactly one* test fail, restore. The mapping is
//! recorded in the group report.
//!
//! # Why the decided rows are reached by `UPDATE` and not by `INSERT`
//!
//! A `pricing_approval` row is **born `submitted`** — the trigger's `INSERT`
//! branch refuses every other state, because §4 names `submitted` as the
//! machine's initial state and because a row born `approved` would hand publish
//! its authorization with no decision ever having been made. That branch is what
//! `a_record_is_born_submitted_or_it_is_not_born` executes, and it is also why
//! every case below that needs a *decided* row seeds a pending one and flips it
//! through the sanctioned `UPDATE`: minting the decided row directly is now
//! refused by the trigger, and a CHECK test that tripped the trigger instead
//! would be evidence about the wrong object.
//!
//! # Both enumerations are driven off the domain's `ALL`, on purpose
//!
//! D-158 requires `pricing_approval` and `pricing_audit_log` to spell one
//! `subject_kind` vocabulary and to be **extended together**. A test naming the
//! two tokens as literals would go on passing the day a third is added to
//! `AuditSubjectKind` and not to `chk_pricing_approval_subject_kind` — which is
//! exactly the drift D-158 exists to prevent — so the storable cases range over
//! `AuditSubjectKind::ALL`, and the state cases over `ApprovalState::ALL` with
//! each row's decision columns taken from that state's own
//! `requires_approver` / `requires_reason`. The refused tokens stay literal, and the
//! one this file uses is **`overlay`** — a member of S5 §6's list that this gear
//! declares no writer for. It used to be `window`, and that sentence went stale in the
//! change that mounted the window surfaces: `window` is declared now, admitted by the
//! CHECK on both backends, and written by `infra::window` and by the unit a window
//! mutation opens. `a_subject_kind_with_no_writer_is_refused` carries a guard that
//! makes the next such move deliberate — it fails if its own literal ever becomes
//! declared, rather than quietly asserting a refusal the store has stopped performing.
//!
//! The `SQLite` mirror carries the same CHECKs by name and splits the one
//! PL/pgSQL function into five literal-message triggers, so
//! `tests/sqlite_approval_repo.rs` and `tests/sqlite_approval_append_only.rs`
//! reach most of this without Docker. What they cannot reach is the branch
//! structure of the PL/pgSQL body — a function may reference a column that does
//! not exist and still be created, failing only when it fires — and that is what
//! these tests execute.
//!
//! Ignored by default; they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing -- --ignored`.
