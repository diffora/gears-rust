//! `POST /bss-pricing/v1/plans/{planId}/publish` — the entrance, driven through

//!
//! # What this suite is for, and what `rest_approvals.rs` is for
//!
//! This one owns the **publish** side: the two arms of the route, the
//! precondition, the approve→commit window, and what the commit does to the
//! units it did not consume. The approval surface's own routes — the queue, the
//! record and the three decisions — are `tests/rest_approvals.rs`.
//!
//! # Every case here puts the world in the state where the guard it names
//! # answers
//!
//! The route has four guards that fire before the interesting one: the authz
//! gate, the `If-Match`, "does the plan hold an open draft", and the validation
//! pipeline. A test that skipped any of them would be answered by that guard and
//! would pass against a handler that never reached the rule it claims to prove.
//! So the suite opens with
//! [`a_publish_of_a_publishable_plan_opens_a_pinned_unit`], which is the world
//! every other case moves exactly one thing away from.

///    for `noConfiguredThreshold` and stages rather than commits.
/// 3. **It is then rejected**, which frees the key `refuse_held_key` would otherwise
///    refuse the plan-revision submit on — the guard that made D-200 call the window
///    narrow, and the one the next case shows the auto-publish arm walked past.
/// 4. **The policy's bar is above the staged move** (200 minor against 1 000 000), so
///    nothing about that row is material on its own. A bar under it would answer
///    `thresholdReached` and this case would pass against the unfixed code for a
///    reason that has nothing to do with the plan's shape.
///
/// Only then is the plan's shape the sole thing that changed, which is what makes
/// `alwaysMaterialTrigger` here mean *D-115's whole-revision clause fired*.
///

/// It holds the **caller**: the evaluator's change set is this unit's rows. It does
/// not hold the **predicate** — `triggers::triggered_by_content` still answers `None`
