//! The window store's guards on the executed `SQLite` mirror.
//!
//! `tests/postgres_window.rs` proves the canonical objects. This suite exists
//! because the mirror is not a copy of them: Postgres carries **one** PL/pgSQL
//! function with five `IF` arms, and `SQLite` — which has no procedural language
//! and whose `RAISE(ABORT, …)` takes a literal message only — carries **five
//! separate triggers**, each with a `WHEN` clause that has to re-state the early
//! return the Postgres arm above it gets for free. Those are five different
//! objects, and a mirror whose arms fire in the wrong order, or whose `WHEN`
//! clauses overlap, is a backend divergence no assertion about Postgres can see.
//!
//! Two of the differences are more than mechanical and each has a test here that
//! could not be written against Postgres at all:
//!
//! * **every instant is `text` here, so every comparison is lexicographic**, and
//!   the rule that makes that safe has two halves. Between two **stored** instants
//!   it is exact — not because the rendering is fixed-width, which it is not
//!   (`AutoSi` picks 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits per value), but because the
//!   offset sign sorts below both the fraction separator and the digits, so a
//!   coarser rendering of an instant always precedes a finer one. That is review
//!   Z2-8's correction and
//!   [`instants_of_three_fractional_widths_inside_one_second_still_order`] executes
//!   it; on that ground `chk_pricing_price_window_interval` and the two ordering
//!   CHECKs compare the columns directly. Against **`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`** it is not, and arm 5 is the
//!   only guard here with the clock on one side: `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` renders
//!   `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, a **space** at byte 11 where the stored text has `T`,
//!   so the arm normalizes with `datetime(…)`.
//!
//!   **The fixtures below are therefore written in the rendering the store
//!   actually holds** — `2099-01-01T00:00:00+00:00`, measured off a `SeaORM`
//!   write, not a legible `2099-01-01 00:00:00 +00:00` — because a test using any
//!   other spelling proves nothing about the deployed comparison. That sentence
//!   used to be here inverted, and it was: the fixtures were space-separated
//!   throughout while arm 5 compared a `substr(…, 1, 19)` prefix that read `'T'`
//!   (0x54) against `' '` (0x20). Every stored instant on **today's UTC date**
//!   therefore sorted greater than the clock and read as future, the arm was
//!   inoperative for exactly that window, and a suite of cross-date fixtures —
//!   where the date prefix decides before byte 11 is reached — kept it green while
//!   an end that had elapsed an hour earlier could be moved thirty days into the
//!   future. [`the_mirror_refuses_an_end_that_passed_earlier_today`] is the case
//!   that would have caught it, and it computes its instants in SQL so that "past"
//!   and "today" are facts rather than fixtures that age.
//! * **the biconditional CHECKs compare booleans on a backend with no boolean
//!   type.** `(state IN ('active','expired')) = (activated_at IS NOT NULL)` is two
//!   `0`/`1` integers here, and it is worth executing rather than reasoning about.
//!
//! Raw SQL throughout, deliberately past every repository — the layer that cannot
//! see a guard stop refusing. `tests/sqlite_window_repo.rs` is the other half: what
//! the repository refuses, and the non-overlap rule no schema object carries.
