//! The per-key pending register — `inst-co-single-pending` as the rule the design
//! set states, rather than as the plan-revision lock that stood in for it.
//!
//! # What this suite owns that no other can
//!
//! The rule is *"at most one pending approval unit **of any kind** may hold a
//! canonical scope key"*, and §5 glosses the code the same way: *"a pending unit
//! already holds one of the touched keys"*. Both sentences are about a **set of
//! keys**. What the crate enforced before this suite was `subject_ref LIKE
//! '<plan_id>/%'` over `subject_kind = 'plan_revision'` — a plan-revision lock,
//! which is a *consequence* of the rule on a plan whose whole key set one unit
//! holds and is neither necessary nor sufficient for it.
//!
//! So two of the three contention cases below **would have passed against the old
//! code**, and one of them is why the third is here at all:
//!
//! * [`a_window_unit_cannot_open_over_a_key_a_plan_unit_holds`] and
//!   [`a_plan_unit_cannot_open_over_a_key_a_window_unit_holds`] fail against the
//!   prefix match, and they fail for the right reason — it carries a
//!   `subject_kind` filter, so a window unit and a plan unit over one key were
//!   invisible to each other.
//! * [`two_units_on_disjoint_keys_of_one_plan_both_open`] is the **negative
//!   control**, and it is the one that makes the other two mean anything. A
//!   plan-level lock refuses both of the first two cases as well — for the wrong
//!   reason — so without a case that a plan-level lock **breaks**, the widening
//!   cannot be told from the code it replaced. This is that case: it passes under
//!   the register and reddens under any lock coarser than a key.
//!
//! # And the register is read back, not merely refused off
//!
//! A refusal test alone cannot tell a unit that held the right keys from one that
//! held every key of the tenant — a register that over-held would refuse
//! *everything* and pass every contention case in this file.
//! [`a_pending_unit_holds_exactly_the_keys_of_its_change_set`] and
//! [`a_decided_unit_frees_every_key_it_held`] are the observability twins, and the
//! second is load-bearing in its own right: the register follows its unit out of
//! `submitted` through a **trigger**, and a sync that silently stopped happening
//! would hold every key forever with nothing about the parent row looking wrong.
//!
//! # And the three properties D-99 states, which are this file's other half
//!
//! `inst-ws-publishunit` makes every window mutation a publish unit, and §9 states
//! what that has to *mean* rather than only what it is called: the mutation records a
//! pending version ref carrying the plan subject, the change is invisible until that
//! version is pin-eligible, a frozen version never moves, and the coverage check runs
//! inside the mutation rather than only at publish. The three tests §9 names —
//! [`a_schedule_is_a_publish_unit_and_is_invisible_until_the_version_is_pin_eligible`],
//! [`a_cancel_re_projects_and_the_old_pin_still_answers_the_old_coverage`] and
//! [`a_schedule_that_opens_a_gap_is_refused_inside_the_mutation`] — are here, and each
//! reads the **`pricing_catalog_version_ref` row** rather than the response body's
//! handle. That distinction is the whole reason they exist: the registry supplies the
//! handle *before* the row is written, so every assertion that read it off the response
//! was satisfied by a mutation that never recorded the ref at all — and wrapping the
//! `record_pending` call in `if false` left the suite green.
//!
//! # Every plan here is **published**, and that is a premise rather than staging
//!
//! A window unit's subject is a window of a published plan:
//! `ApprovalService::submit_window_mutation` resolves the plan's *current*
//! revision, exactly as `infra::window` does, so a plan that never published has
//! no window unit to open. The plan is therefore published for real before any of
//! it, and the successor draft the plan-revision cases need is opened explicitly.

/// **A window cannot be scheduled on a plan that has never published, and the two

///
/// The file's own premise banner says every plan here is published because the window
/// paths resolve the plan's *current* revision. This is the one case about the other
/// side of that premise, and it exists because the refusal reads like an accident:
/// `plan_repo::load_current` is `published | retired`, so a reader can conclude the 404
/// is a side effect of which repository function this path happened to reuse, and
/// delete it.
///
/// D-314 records that it is not, and the two assertions here guard the two **separate**
/// enforcements — which is the point, because either can be relaxed without the other:
///
/// 1. the surface refuses, naming the current plan revision as what is absent. This arm
///    is what reddens if the domain check is lifted: the act then runs to step 6 and
///    aborts at the write, so `schedule` answers `Internal` and the `match` below takes
///    its panicking arm. A domain relaxation cannot pass this case quietly, and it
///    converts a truthful 404 into a 500 rather than authoring anything.
/// 2. the ref row such a mutation would record at step 6 is refused **by the store** —
///    `chk_pricing_catalog_version_ref_subject_lifecycle` admits no `draft`. This arm
///    guards the *other* direction, and nothing else in the crate's fast tier does: a
///    later migration that widens or drops that `CHECK` — reasoning that `superseded`
///    is the token it was written for, which it is and which its Postgres twin now
///    spells out is only half of what it keeps out — leaves assertion (1) perfectly
///    green while removing the ground D-314's second half rests on.
///
/// The second assertion is written against `record_pending`, which is the call
/// `mutate_in` makes, with the two arguments the relaxed path would supply: the draft's
/// own revision number and its own lifecycle state, both taken off the record the way
/// `read_plan_context` takes them. It asserts the **constraint by name**, its Postgres
/// twin's discipline: `is_err()` alone is satisfied by any storage failure, so a chain
/// that dropped this `CHECK` and refused the insert on some other column would keep the
/// case green while the guarantee was gone.
