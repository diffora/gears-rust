//! D-05's retirement unwind, held open by probes rather than by prose.
//!
//! `inst-co-retirement-unwind` (Slice 7 step 7) and `inst-rt-cancel` (Slice 11
//! step 2) require that a plan retirement **unwind a live cutover unit in the
//! same transaction**: the predecessor window's `effectiveTo` restored to its
//! recorded pre-cutover value, the scheduled copy and successor windows
//! cancelled, the unit closed as `unwound` — a merely `submitted` unit voided per
//! the Slice 5 pin semantics — and the whole act registered always-material.
//!
//! None of the first four is built. That much was already on record in one place
//! (Slice 11's AC list, *"Slice 7's `inst-co-retirement-unwind` has no
//! implementation"*) and absent from the one list whose job is to name what
//! `retire_in` does not do. What was on record **nowhere** is the part this file
//! exists for: two of D-05's clauses were not merely unbuilt, they were not
//! **constructible** in this crate as it stood, and each was blocked on a
//! different missing thing. **One of the two was built on 2026-08-17** and this
//! file is now the account of both halves.
//!
//! * The predecessor's pre-cutover `effectiveTo` was **overwritten in place** by
//!   the act that would have to be undone, with no row, no event and no audit
//!   entry preserving it. It is recorded now:
//!   `a_cutover_records_the_effective_to_it_overwrites` reads the value back out
//!   of the audit pair through `audit_repo::for_subject`, and
//!   `the_audit_before_image_agrees_with_the_pre_cutover_frozen_delta` checks it
//!   against the one other store that independently holds the same interval.
//!   Two cases hold the **restore** the operand exists for:
//!   `the_append_only_trigger_does_not_refuse_the_unwinds_restore` and
//!   `an_open_ended_predecessor_is_recorded_as_null_and_restorable_to_null`.
//! * `unwound` is not a state this crate's approval machine has, and it is not a
//!   state the **design set** declares either: `05-governance.md` §4's approval
//!   state machine lists `submitted, approved, rejected, voided` and §6's `state`
//!   column repeats exactly those four. Minting a fifth here is what D-204 clause (2)
//!   refuses — *"a gear may mint an internal variant freely; a wire code is the
//!   set's to declare"* — which
//!   `domain::retirement::strand_free_disposition` already cites from the other
//!   side. `the_approval_machine_has_no_unwound_state` holds that.
//!
//! And one clause **is** paid, under another name:
//! `a_retirement_over_a_live_cutover_is_material_under_the_trigger_it_already_declares`
//! shows that D-05's always-material half needs no
//! `Trigger::RetirementUnwindingACutover` at all, because D-109 made retirement
//! unconditionally material and both declarations answer under the same rule.
//!
//! **The reason that sentence used to give stopped being true on 2026-08-16.** It
//! read *"and `MaterialityVerdict` carries no trigger identity for the two to
//! differ in"*, which is how D-327 clause (4) argued the clause paid. The verdict
//! carries the trigger now, so the two declarations **are** distinguishable in the
//! stored record; what survives is that neither changes whether a second principal
//! is required. That case asserts both halves, and the difference is owed back to
//! the register rather than smoothed over here.
//!
//! # Why the whole unwind and not the three clauses that *are* constructible
//!
//! Finding the live unit, cancelling the two scheduled windows and — since the
//! operand landed — restoring the bound off the trail can all be written today.
//! Writing any proper subset produces exactly the state D-05 rejected option (a)
//! to avoid: a predecessor still shortened to the cutover instant with the
//! schedules that were to take over from it gone — the trailing void no gap check
//! can see, arriving as the *result* of the fix. A half unwind is worse than
//! none, so this file records the whole of it as absent and
//! `a_retirement_over_a_live_cutover_unwinds_nothing` is the case that flips when
//! it lands.
//!
//! # Every instant is a fixed date
//!
//! `sqlite_cutover_unit`'s rule and its fixtures: the world sits inside `common`'s
//! coverage window `[2099-08-04, 2099-09-01)`, the cutover is at 2099-08-20, and
//! "now" is a constant. The predecessor's coverage window therefore ends at a
//! **finite** instant, which is the whole point of the first case: after the
//! shorten there is no way to tell that window from one that had been open-ended,
//! and `compose_cutover_windows` accepts both (`WindowInterval::covers` is
//! satisfied by an absent end and by any end strictly after the cutover alike).

/// # The claim
///
/// `m20260802_000016` arm 5 (Postgres twin in `m20260802_000021`) refuses any move
/// of `effective_to` where `OLD` or `NEW` is non-NULL and `<= now()`. Read cold that
/// looks like it forbids putting a bound back. It does not, inside D-05's scope, and
/// the argument has three legs:
///
/// 1. the cutover is **approved and not yet effective**, so `OLD` is the cutover
///    instant `T`, and `T > now`;
/// 2. `NEW` is the original bound, which the cutover *shortened* — so it is strictly
///    later than `T`, hence `> T > now`;
/// 3. a NULL original bound skips the clause entirely (its own case, below).
///
/// A comment asserting that is a claim. This is the measurement, and it is armed so
/// that a change to any leg reddens it: the two instants are asserted to stand in the
/// order the argument needs **before** the write is attempted, and a control move to
/// an instant in the past is asserted to be refused, so a green cannot be the trigger
/// having been dropped or the clause having stopped firing.
///
/// # What *does* stand in the restore's way, which is not the trigger
///
/// `adjust_effective_to` runs `refuse_overlap` over `OCCUPYING_STATES`, and the
/// successor's `[cutover, …)` is on the predecessor's own key — so lengthening the
/// predecessor past the cutover while that window is still `scheduled` is
/// `WINDOW_OVERLAP`. The cancel therefore has to come first, and that ordering is
/// forced by a rule rather than chosen; it is the reverse of the order D-05's own
/// sentence lists the clauses in. The grandfathered copy does not participate:
/// `inst-co-copy` moves it to a **new generation's** key, so it is on a different
/// plane. This case performs the cancel first for exactly that reason, and the
/// refusal it would otherwise take is asserted, so the ordering is pinned rather than

/// because it protects a different key.
///
/// D-182 keeps `PresenceMap::fail_closed()` the built system's only case, so
/// today the condemned set is empty and the case above measures a retirement that
/// cancels nothing. This one asks the domain the question the lane will make
/// answerable, over the window plane a committed cutover leaves behind:
///
/// * the predecessor, on the `all_subscriptions` key, ending **at** the cutover;
/// * the successor, on that same key, `[cutover, …)` — a candidate, not yet active;
/// * the grandfathered copy, on the generation's key, `[cutover, …)` — also a
///   candidate.
///
/// With nobody in flight, `dispose_windows` condemns both candidates and
/// `strand_free_disposition` re-keeps only the **copy**: D-04's bound is a
/// question about a grandfathered generation's coverage, and the successor is not
/// on one. So the `all_subscriptions` key is left with a predecessor that stops at
/// the cutover and nothing after it — uncovered from the cutover instant onward,
/// which is exactly the trailing void D-05 exists to prevent and no gap check can
/// see.
///
/// That reframes what the unwind is owed for. Slice 11's AC list files it as
/// *"Slice 7's to build"*, a missing callee; it is also a **latent defect of this
/// surface**, armed and waiting on the same lane D-316's residual waits on. The
/// two arrive together and neither is closed by the lane landing.
///
/// The positive control is the copy's verdict: the guard does fire here, on the
/// key it is for, so a green on the successor's line is not the guard being inert.
