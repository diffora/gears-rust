//! `bulk_repo`'s own surface **on the engine that runs in production**
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §4, §6; D-260, D-262, D-267, D-290,
//! D-294).
//!
//! `sqlite_bulk_repo` drives the same repository against the mirror, and until
//! this file that was the *only* place this code ran. The three bulk tables each
//! carry a schema suite on both engines, but the code over them was exercised on
//! `SQLite` alone — so every Postgres-only fact about it was unproven: the entity
//! mapping onto `jsonb`/`timestamptz`/`uuid` columns rather than the mirror's
//! `text`, the constraint names a refusal carries, and the statement-abort
//! semantics the next paragraph is entirely about.
//!
//! # The one rule `SQLite` structurally cannot test
//!
//! [`bulk_repo::take_locks`]'s doc requires an **autocommit connection, not a
//! transaction**, and gives the reason: Postgres aborts an enclosing transaction
//! on a failed statement, so the work that happens *after* the colliding insert —
//! the partial release, and the read that names the holder — would itself fail
//! inside one, degrading the refusal from `RepoError::BulkRowLocked` to a bare
//! `RepoError::Db` and losing exactly the run `fr-concurrent-edit` requires it to
//! name. `SQLite` does not abort on a failed statement, so its cases pass whether
//! or not a caller honours the contract, and a caller that stopped honouring it
//! would keep every `SQLite` suite green while production reported a driver error
//! where an operator needs a run id.
//!
//! [`take_locks_inside_a_transaction_loses_the_holder`] is that case. It is a
//! characterisation rather than a wish: it pins what the shipping engine actually
//! does when the contract is broken, which is what makes the contract a rule
//! instead of a comment.
//!
//! Running it also **corrects the doc's account of the mechanism**. `take_locks`
//! says the read that names the holder is what fails inside a transaction, and
//! adds that "the partial release below has the same requirement". Measured, it
//! is the other way round: the release runs first and carries a `?`, so it is the
//! statement that actually dies and the holder read is never reached. The
//! conclusion the doc draws is right — the refusal degrades to `RepoError::Db`
//! and the holder is lost — but the sentence naming the read as the mechanism is
//! not, and the case asserts the release by name so the two cannot drift again.
//!
//! Run with:
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_bulk_repo -- --ignored`.

/// **The autocommit contract, on the only engine where it is a contract.**

/// connection and not a transaction. This case drives it inside one and pins what
/// actually happens: Postgres aborts the enclosing transaction the moment the
/// colliding insert fails, so the statements that follow it — the partial release
/// first, then the read that names the holder — cannot run, and the refusal comes
/// back as a bare `RepoError::Db` instead of a `RepoError::BulkRowLocked` naming
/// the holding run.
///
/// It is asserted against the *same* contention the case above resolves cleanly
/// on an autocommit connection, which is what makes it a statement about the
/// runner rather than about the fixture. Together the two are the arming for
/// `postgres_bulk_commit`'s holder-naming case: a `commit_batch` that took its
/// locks inside a transaction would degrade exactly this way, every `SQLite`
/// suite would stay green, and an operator would get a driver error where
