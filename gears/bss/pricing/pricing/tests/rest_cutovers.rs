//! `rest_supersessions.rs`'s sibling, and what it asserts is what **that** suite
//! cannot: the shape of a cutover's `202`. The unit's own behaviour — two keys, two

//! pinned one layer down in `sqlite_cutover_unit.rs`, and repeating it here would be
//! two descriptions of one act, free to disagree.
//!
//! So the cases below are about **the wire**: the two arms and their tokens, the
//! fields that are absent rather than zeroed on the controlled one, the generation
//! key rendered at full arity, and the two refusals a caller can provoke from the
//! path alone.
//!
//! Every instant is fixed, inside `common`'s `[2099-08-04, 2099-09-01)` coverage
//! window and clear of both of `inst-gc-compose`'s floors against a wall clock that
//! is nowhere near 2099.
