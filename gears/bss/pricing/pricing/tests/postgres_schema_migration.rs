//! Slice 11's migration schedule **on the engine that runs in production**
//! (`design/11-lifecycle.md` §4/§6, `inst-ms-api`, `inst-mg-idem`,
//! `inst-mg-cancel`, `inst-mst-start`, `inst-mst-complete`, `inst-mst-cancel`,
//! `inst-mst-cancel-inflight`, D-34, D-49, D-65).
//!
//! # The hole this closes
//!
//! `bss.pricing_migration` carries twelve `CHECK` constraints and a five-arm
//! append-only function, and until this file **no Postgres suite drove a single
//! statement at it**. `sqlite_migration_repo` proves four of the five arms on the
//! mirror; `postgres_migrations` proves the objects exist here by name and runs
//! nothing. The two arms are written separately — one PL/pgSQL function against
//! four `RAISE(ABORT, …)` triggers — and only the `SQLite` side carries a
//! trigger-**body** digest census, so a lost disjunct on the shipping engine was
//! invisible to every gate. That is the standing half of the debt D-260 records.
//!
//! Not one of the twelve `CHECK`s had a behavioural case on **either** engine:
//! `sqlite_migration_repo` drives the repository, and a repository only ever
//! offers legal values — every flip it emits carries its own instant and its own
//! compare-and-swap. Driving it catches a constraint that got *narrower* and is
//! blind to one that was dropped.
//!
//! # Which layer is reachable from which statement
//!
//! Stated once here rather than rediscovered per case. The append-only function
//! is `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE`, so on an `UPDATE` it answers **before** any
//! constraint is evaluated:
//!
//! * a `CHECK` is reachable from an `INSERT` always, and from an `UPDATE` only
//!   when no arm raises first — which is why every constraint case below is
//!   driven by an `INSERT`;
//! * `chk_pricing_migration_state` is therefore `INSERT`-only in practice: a flip
//!   to a state outside §4's four is answered by the whitelist arm;
//! * and a statement refused by two layers proves neither, so each case below
//!   moves exactly **one** thing away from a row that lands.
//!
//! Run with:
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_schema_migration -- --ignored`.
