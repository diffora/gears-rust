//! The TOCTOU guard's race, on real Postgres: a mutation of the pinned subject
//! and an approve of its record, concurrently.
//!
//! # Why this cannot be a `SQLite` suite
//!
//! `sqlite::memory:` **serializes writers**, so the interleaving under test can
//! be neither confirmed nor refuted there — not "probably fine", unanswered in
//! both directions. `tests/sqlite_approval_service.rs` proves that a mutation
//! voids a pending unit and that a decided unit refuses a second decision; what
//! it cannot show is what happens when the two statements are **in flight at the
//! same time**, which is the whole hazard `inst-ap-pin` names.
//!
//! # The choreography, and why each step is there
//!
//! A concurrency test that starts two tasks and asserts on the outcome is a coin
//! toss with a green side. Both races here are driven by observable events only,
//! in the idiom `tests/postgres_audit_chain.rs` established:
//!
//! 1. the mutating transaction runs its write — which includes the void — and
//!    then **parks**, holding the row lock on the pending record;
//! 2. the approving call starts; its read sees the still-committed `submitted`
//!    row, and its compare-and-swap blocks on that lock;
//! 3. a third connection **observes the block** in `pg_locks`, which is what
//!    proves the approve's read already happened;
//! 4. only then is the mutation released to commit, and the approve's `UPDATE`
//!    re-evaluates its `state = 'submitted'` predicate under READ COMMITTED,
//!    matches nothing, and resolves into the refusal.
//!
//! Step 3 is the load-bearing one. Without it the approve could read the *voided*
//! row and be refused by its own pendingness check before ever contending —
//! green, and about nothing.
//!
//! # What "exactly one wins" means here, precisely
//!
//! The contended object is the **pending record**, and what is at stake is which
//! of two writes to it takes effect. The two orderings are not symmetric and
//! both are asserted:
//!
//! - **The void commits first.** The approve loses and is answered
//!   `APPROVAL_NOT_PENDING` — a **409**, the outcome §5 specifies — rather than
//!   the driver error a repository that trusted its read would produce, which
//!   reaches an operator as a 500 about a race whose whole remedy is to re-read.
//! - **The approve commits first.** The void's `UPDATE` matches nothing and the
//!   mutation still commits. That is deliberate and load-bearing rather than a
//!   loss: `inst-as-immutable` makes a decided record untouchable, so a void that
//!   tried to close it would be refused by
//!   `trg_pricing_approval_append_only` — and because the void runs inside the
//!   mutation's transaction, that refusal would roll the **mutation** back. Every
//!   authoring edit to a plan that had ever been approved would fail.
//!
//! The residue of the second case is reported rather than hidden: an approval
//! that has already been granted is **not** re-invalidated by a later mutation.
//! `inst-ap-pin` scopes the void to a `submitted` record in as many words ("any
//! mutation of the subject **while `submitted`**"), so this is the design set's
//! own boundary and not a hole in the implementation of it — but it means the
//! window between `approved` and the publish commit is guarded by nothing here.
//! Closing it belongs to the publish handler, which holds the record's
//! `content_hash` and can re-verify the pin before handing
//! `PublishAuthorization::Approved` to `commit`.
//!
//! # The mint guard's two cases, and what each of them would fail against
//!
//! The last two cases in this file are D-192's, and they are about different halves of
//! one guard. [`the_policy_mint_guard_answers_a_pending_unit_conflict_on_postgres`] pins
//! its **classification** — that a `unique_violation` over
//! `uq_pricing_approval_policy_pending` is read as the mint guard and not as the table's
//! primary key — and needs no race at all; it would fail against a Postgres that stopped
//! rendering the index name.
//! [`two_proposals_intersecting_on_a_currency_meet_the_mint_guard_and_not_the_version_key`]
//! pins its **ordering**: that the guard stands *above* the mint rather than below it. It
//! would fail against `ThresholdService::propose` as `f69845790` found it, with the
//! version rows written first — the loser then met
//! `pricing_approval_threshold`'s `(tenant, version, currency)` key instead of the guard,
//! and a violation of *that* key is a bare `RepoError::Db` rendering **500**, a server
//! fault for a race whose whole remedy is to decide or withdraw the proposal the tenant
//! already holds. Swap the two writes back in `propose` and that case reddens on the
//! refusal's shape, which is the only thing the swap moves.
//!
//! Ignored by default; they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p cf-gears-bss-pricing --test postgres_approval_race -- --ignored`.
