//! The at-most-once gate **on the engine that runs in production** (§9,
//! `inst-bk-idem`, D-143).
//!
//! # Why this file exists (Z12-7)
//!
//! `tests/sqlite_idempotency.rs` is 644 lines and drives the whole gate against
//! the mirror; until this file that was the *only* place the claim path ran. Every
//! `postgres_*` file naming the gate is a **schema** suite — the table, its
//! `CHECK`s, its key — so the behaviour over it was engine-untested, and the gate's
//! behaviour is more engine-dependent than most code in this crate:
//!
//! * the row is `bytea`/`jsonb`/`timestamptz` here and `blob`/`text`/`text` on the
//!   mirror, so the digest comparison, the replayed body and the expiry
//!   subtraction all run against different types than the ones the `SQLite`
//!   assertions cover;
//! * `claim`'s own doc names a `RepoError::Db` arm for *"the conflicting row being
//!   unreadable inside the transaction that just collided with it"* — an
//!   engine-specific hazard that had no engine-specific test at all;
//! * and the case `SQLite` **structurally cannot** run is the one the gate exists
//!   for. `sqlite_idempotency`'s own module doc says so: *"On `SQLite` a race
//!   cannot be staged anyway — one writer, transactions serialized — so a racing
//!   test would prove nothing while looking like it proved everything."* Two
//!   duplicates arriving at once is the situation the `PRIMARY KEY` and the
//!   `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` were chosen over a read-then-write for, and it is
//!   staged here.
//!
//! # This suite is the twin, not a second full pass
//!
//! The vocabulary cases — one key under another operation, another tenant's claim,
//! a status without a body — are facts about predicates that do not vary by
//! engine, and duplicating them here would double the slowest tier for nothing.
//! What is here is the set whose answer could differ: the round trip through the
//! real column types, the two refusals, the expiry boundary against a real
//! `timestamptz`, and the race.
//!
//! Run with:
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_idempotency -- --ignored`.
