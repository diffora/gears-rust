//! What a clone copies, what it remaps and what it deliberately leaves behind
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §3 `algo-clone`, `inst-cl-*`; D-19,
//! D-264, D-268, D-269).
//!
//! Driven through the real repositories rather than over a hand-built world,
//! because every claim here is about what the *store* ends up holding — and this
//! program has spent a day on rules whose operand nothing populated. A copy
//! asserted against a fixture the test itself assembled would prove nothing about
//! the copier.
//!
//! # The phase remap is what this suite is mostly for
//!
//! Three sites reference a `phase_id`, and the third is the one the 2026-08-01
//! review found missing (C-7): the chain, the price rows' scope keys, and the
//! keys of the D-41 `entitlement_grants.perPhase` map. A clone that remapped the
//! first two and not the third publishes a grant set pointing at phases that
//! exist only in the source, and fails `GRANT_SET_PHASE_UNKNOWN` on its first
//! publish — which is a refusal the *operator* has no way to act on, the dangling
//! ids being invisible to them.
//!
//! # What is asserted about the resets, and what is not
//!
//! Since D-268 both cutover-made eligibility classes are excluded, so **every
//! row that reaches the reset already carries `all_subscriptions` and
//! `cohort = none`**. Those two assertions are therefore fences rather than
//! evidence — true of a value nothing had to move — and are marked as such where
//! they stand, beside the pair D-266 already demoted. What the suite proves
//! instead is the **exclusion**: the clone holds no row on the market only a
//! `new_subscriptions_only` row occupied, the receipt names each class it left
//! behind, and a source holding both classes on **one** market clones without
//! the collapse `inst-cl-resets` names only for grandfathered rows.

/// §3's copy set predates Slice 8 and names none of the bundle tables, while

/// The identity is re-minted because `pricing_bundle.plan_id` is unique per
