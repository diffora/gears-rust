//! `pricing_plan_period_floor_cap` against a real database (**D-319**) — the
//! market key, the five `CHECK`s that make a bound usable, the append-only
//! triggers, and the repository statements that write the set.
//!
//! Everything worth proving here is a property of the **schema**, of a
//! **statement**, or of what the repository leaves behind — never of a branch in
//! Rust. A mock would assert that the repository's own `if` fires and would keep
//! asserting it after the constraint that matters had been deleted.
//!
//! The suite carries **two** harnesses, as its three sibling suites do. The
//! constraint and trigger cases drive raw SQL through `common::migrated_db`,
//! because a bound row under a published revision is a state no typed path will
//! ever produce and the guards exist precisely for what reaches the table
//! outside this gear. The repository cases drive `PlanShapeRepo`.
//!
//! **Why the five `CHECK`s are here and the publish rules are not.** Each of
//! them has a `PERIOD_FLOOR_CAP_AMOUNT_INVALID` rule that explains it in a
//! report line (S2 `inst-pfc-amount`, D-148's arrangement), and those rules are
//! unit-tested where they live. What this file proves is the half a report line
//! cannot: that the row is refused **by the store**, so a bound that admits no
//! bill cannot exist even if every rule above it were deleted. The market rule
//! (`inst-pfc-market`) has no counterpart here on purpose — "the plan sells this
//! market" is a fact about the plan's price rows, which no constraint on this
//! table can see.
//!
//! Postgres mirrors every rule here as one PL/pgSQL trigger function and the
//! same `CHECK`s, index, FK and PK — `tests/postgres_migrations.rs` asserts all
//! of them by name on that engine — so no testcontainers case is added; see the
//! migration's module doc for the transform.
