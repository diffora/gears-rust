//! `GET /catalog/skus`, driven with a catalog that actually answers.
//!
//! # Why this binary exists rather than a case in the shared harness
//!
//! All three places that mount this router — `rest_support/mod.rs`,
//! `module_test.rs` and `rest_authz.rs` — wire
//! `UnconfiguredProductCatalogClientV1`, whose `list_skus` returns
//! `Err(unconfigured_catalog())` unconditionally. The handler has
//! three arms and only the middle one was reachable in the entire suite: 200
//! with `source: "unconfigured"` and no items. `view_of`, `state.source` as a
//! *real* source name, and the 503 arm had zero coverage, and no test asserted
//! anything at all about a response from this route — the path constant appeared
//! in the two route censuses and nowhere else.
//!
//! Proven rather than assumed at the time it was found: replacing the `Ok(skus)`
//! arm with `unreachable!()` left `module_test` at 14 passed / 0 failed and
//! `rest_authz` at 21 passed / 0 failed.
//!
//! Those three mounts are left exactly as they are. The unconfigured client is
//! the right double for a census and for the authz properties, which range over
//! every mounted route and have no business depending on a registry. This binary
//! mounts the same router with the state a configured deployment has, which is
//! the only thing the shared harness could not supply.
//!
//! # What the route's own contract says, and what is therefore asserted
//!
//! "**Read `source` before `items`**: `unconfigured` with no items means no
//! registry was asked, which is not the same fact as a tenant that sells
//! nothing." That sentence is unfalsifiable while only one arm runs, so the
//! three cases here are the three distinguishable answers — a real source with
//! items, the unconfigured non-answer, and the configured-but-failing 503 that
//! must NOT be flattened into an empty 200.
