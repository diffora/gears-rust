//! `GET/PUT /config/approval-threshold-policy`, driven through the real router.

//! # The positive control comes first, and it is the bootstrap

//! D-10 makes a policy `PUT` an always-material act, so *every* case here is one
//! move away from [`the_first_proposal_is_itself_material_and_a_second_principal_makes_it_effective`]
//! — the full round trip: propose, review, approve, and only then is the policy in
//! force. Without that world a service that opened a unit and never made anything
//! effective would satisfy every refusal in the file, which is this program's own
//! standing warning about a rule that refuses everything passing its refusal test.
//!
//! # The `202` is the whole point, and the `GET` is what proves it
//!
//! A test asserting only that the `PUT` answers 202 cannot tell "the proposal is
//! waiting for a reviewer" from "the proposal was applied and the response is
//! mislabelled". So each proposal case reads the policy back: before the approval
//! the effective policy is unchanged, after it the new version is in force. That
//! pairing is the assertion; the status code is a detail of it.

/// starts there. Until this decision it was also a state no tenant could **return**
/// to: the policy is per-currency rows keyed `(tenant, version, currency)`, so "no
/// thresholds" would have to be a version with zero rows — which the authoring door
/// refuses (`THRESHOLD_INVALID`) and which, if admitted, `latest_version` could not
/// see and no pin could cover. What was missing was **expressiveness**: the sentence
/// here used to say the only way back was "a version of absurdly high bars" which
/// "stops being true the day a currency is added", and both halves were wrong.
/// `reaches_absolute` is `magnitude >= absolute_minor`, so a high bar makes *fewer*
/// changes material — the arithmetic way back is a bar of **zero**, which the CHECK
/// permits — and a currency with no entry meets `inst-mat-percurrency`'s fail-safe,
/// so nothing silently stops being true. What a zero-bar version cannot do is say
/// what the operator meant, which is what an auditor needs.
///
/// So the way back is a **tombstone**: a version that positively says *this tenant
/// has no thresholds*, minted with the next number, pinned, and approved by an
/// independent principal like every other policy diff (D-10). Every clause of that
/// sentence is asserted here, because between them they are the decision:
///
/// * the retirement answers **202** with a pending unit, not 200 with a diff applied;
/// * the old policy is **still in force** while that unit is open — a tenant must not
///   be able to revert the two-person rule single-handed;
/// * once approved the tombstone is the **effective** version, and it is `entries: []`
///   rather than `effective: null`, which is what distinguishes an authored *none*
///   from a tenant that never configured anything.
