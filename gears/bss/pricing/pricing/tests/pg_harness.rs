//! The shared-Postgres harness's own guards, executed.
//!
//! **No Docker and no server**, deliberately. What is asserted here is the
//! prune's *decision* — a pure question about a database name and a process id —
//! and standing a container up to ask it would make the harness's only test
//! depend on the harness it is testing. `#[ignore]` is therefore absent too:
//! these run in the ordinary suite, which is where a guard about not destroying
//! a concurrent run's data belongs.
//!
//! Why the guard exists at all is in `pg_support`'s module doc: the previous
//! rule — skip whatever has a live connection — was disproven by inspection, and
//! two concurrent `cargo test` invocations could drop each other's databases
//! mid-run.
