//! The physical guards on `pricing_plan`, proven against a real database: the
//! append-only whitelist, the two partial `UNIQUE` indexes, and the table's
//! `CHECK` constraints.
//!
//! They are one suite because one rule rests on all three. A `revision` number
//! is an **identity** — minted once for a plan and never again (D-145) — and
//! the mechanism that keeps it true is a discarded draft becoming an
//! `abandoned` tombstone instead of disappearing. That needs the CHECK to admit
//! the token, the trigger to keep the tombstone frozen and undeletable, and
//! **both** partial predicates to exclude it, so a plan can accumulate
//! tombstones while still holding exactly one open draft and one current
//! revision. A repository-level suite cannot see any of it: these are properties
//! of the schema, and the engine is not the only thing that can reach the table.
//!
//! Postgres carries the whitelist as one PL/pgSQL trigger and `SQLite` mirrors
//! it as three `RAISE(ABORT, ...)` triggers (see the migration's module doc), so
//! the guards are exercisable without Docker.
//!
//! The Slice-2 shape columns are held to the same two standards, one case each:
//! their value sets and pairings are `CHECK`-constrained, and **every one of
//! them is enumerated in the frozen-column whitelist**. The enumeration is the
//! point of `a_published_revision_freezes_every_column_the_whitelist_names`: a
//! column added to the table and forgotten in the trigger is a column an ad-hoc
//! UPDATE can move under a frozen `CatalogVersion`, which the projector's warm
//! re-drive then re-materializes (§4.4) — the whole class of defect the
//! whitelist exists to close, and one no smaller test can notice.
