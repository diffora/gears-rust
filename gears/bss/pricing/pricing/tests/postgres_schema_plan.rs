//! `pricing_plan`, proved by **executing the statement each object must
//! refuse**, on Postgres.
//!
//! # Why this suite exists
//!
//! `m20260802_000001` is the oldest migration in the chain and until Phase 3 it
//! had never run on the backend it targets: the `SQLite` mirror was what every
//! test reached, and the mirror is a *different* set of objects — three
//! `RAISE(ABORT, …)` triggers with literal messages where Postgres has one
//! PL/pgSQL function with four arms. `tests/sqlite_plan_guards.rs` therefore
//! proves the mirror, not this table.
//!
//! `tests/postgres_migrations.rs` closed half the remaining gap by pinning the
//! CHECK, trigger and partial-index rosters **by name**, so an object cannot
//! vanish unnoticed. It issues no DML, so it says the objects reached the server
//! and nothing about what any of them does. This suite is the other half: one
//! executed refusal per object, and the assertion names the object the refusal
//! came from.
//!
//! # The three rules every test here follows
//!
//! **Execute the refusal.** A test that writes valid values is not evidence
//! about a guard. It catches a constraint that got *narrower* — the writer
//! starts failing — and never one that stopped refusing.
//!
//! **Put the world in the state where the object under test is what answers.**
//! A refusal an *earlier* guard produced is not evidence about the guard the
//! test names. This table makes the hazard concrete twice over. The four value
//! CHECKs on the frequency columns overlap with
//! `chk_pricing_plan_custom_interval_pairing`, which reads all three of them at
//! once, so every refusal below moves exactly one column of an otherwise-valid
//! row and leaves the pairing satisfied. And the trigger's arms are ordered:
//! the frozen-column arm is tested before the published-plane flip arm, so a
//! statement that moves a content column can never be evidence about the flip
//! whitelist and vice versa.
//!
//! **Assert the object, never the table.** Every CHECK, index and trigger over
//! this table has `pricing_plan` in its name, as does the column list Postgres
//! prints for a unique violation, as does every one of the trigger's four
//! messages. A test that accepted any error naming the table would pass with
//! the guard it means to prove switched off.
//!
//! ## The two flip arms share a sentence, and the assertions do not
//!
//! `bss.pricing_plan_append_only()` raises the *same* wording — `lifecycle_state
//! % -> % is not a sanctioned flip` — from the draft-plane arm and from the
//! published-plane arm. What separates them is the interpolated pair, so every
//! flip assertion here carries it: `draft -> superseded` can only have come from
//! the arm that judges drafts, `superseded -> published` only from the arm that
//! judges everything else.
//!
//! # Positives are load-bearing
//!
//! Every guard here is a whitelist rather than a blanket ban, so the suite
//! carries the accepting cases too: all five lifecycle tokens store, the four
//! sanctioned flips are taken, a draft revision's content moves freely, a plan
//! holds one draft beside one current revision beside any number of tombstones,
//! and a well-formed custom interval lands. Without those a table nothing can be
//! written to at all would pass.
//!
//! # One object this suite deliberately does not test by refusal
//!
//! `idx_pricing_plan_tenant` is a **non-unique, non-partial** index. It refuses
//! nothing; its only observable effect is on plan choice, which is not a
//! correctness property and would make a brittle test. Its presence is pinned by
//! name in `tests/postgres_migrations.rs`, and that is the whole of what can be
//! said about it here.
//!
//! Ignored by default; they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_schema_plan -- --ignored`.

/// refuses every non-draft UPDATE that is not `published -> superseded|retired`,

/// those statements *land*; it makes them come back with arm 4's sentence, which
/// this suite catches only because the assertion names the message.
