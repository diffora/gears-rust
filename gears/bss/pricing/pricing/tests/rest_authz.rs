//! The authz gate, proved over the **set** rather than per route.
//!
//! Everything before this proved the gate one route at a time, which leaves two
//! holes an in-process suite can close and only closes deliberately.
//!
//! The first is a route gated on the **wrong pair**. No allow/deny test can see
//! it: a `plan x read` gate on a mutating route allows exactly the callers a
//! `plan x write` gate would in every fixture that grants both, and denies
//! exactly the ones it would in every fixture that grants neither. Only a
//! resolver that records what it was asked can tell. That is the census below.
//!
//! The second is a route added later **with no gate at all**. A per-route suite
//! grows a hole the moment somebody adds a route and forgets its test; a census
//! driven from the registered path set fails instead.
//!
//! # What this suite cannot prove, and does not pretend to
//!
//! **The role matrix is the PDP's, not this gear's.** Which role holds
//! `plan x write`, and whether `FinanceReviewer` can read what it approves
//! (D-61's reviewability invariant), are decisions in
//! `05-governance.md`'s role table that this gear neither implements nor can
//! observe: it asks a question and binds the answer. Nothing here substitutes
//! for testing that table where it lives.
//!
//! **Nothing here is an isolation-level property.** Everything runs over
//! `sqlite::memory:`, which serializes writers.

    // `config` is the fifth, mounted by Slice 4's taxonomy pair, and it is the

    // `config` and nothing was filed under it, so the sentence "a policy route

/// Every router the REST layer defines is merged into **every** place that has to
/// mount it — the production mount and the three test-side ones.
///
/// # The hole this closes, and how it was found
///
/// Four functions merge routers by hand, because each router takes a differently
/// typed state and no loop can build them: `module.rs`'s `register_rest` (the
/// production mount), `registered_paths` above, `module_test.rs`'s
/// `registered_operations`, and `rest_support`'s `Harness` app. Every set-level
/// property in this file and the whole route census in `module_test.rs` range over
/// what those functions build — so a router none of them merges is a router **no
/// census can see**, and the guards read as coverage while covering nothing.
///
/// That was live on 2026-08-04. A sixth router (`windows`) was mounted in
/// `module.rs` and the census in `module_test.rs` — the one whose doc promised "a
/// path registered without a line here fails the census" — **stayed green**,
/// because its own router list did not include it. The route was registered,
/// declared, catalogued, and invisible to both censuses; the harness did not mount
/// it either, so every request to it answered 404 without ever reaching the gate.
///
/// So the scan is over the **source text** of the four functions' files — the
/// `scannable()` text and not the raw bytes, see below. It cannot check that the
/// merge is correct — only that the name appears — which is exactly the guarantee
/// needed: it forces an author who adds a router to visit all four, and the
/// censuses then do the rest.
///
/// # It reads stripped source, and that was the second repair (Z12-8)
///
/// The scan read the raw file until 2026-08-14, so a merge **commented out**
/// still carried its own needle and the guard passed over the exact regression it
/// was written for. Its two sibling scans in this file had used `scannable()`
/// from the start and said why; this one was the holdout. Verified rather than
/// argued: commenting `module_test.rs`'s `taxonomies` merge out left the raw-text
/// version green and reddens this one, naming the file and the router.
///
/// # It keys on the function, not the module, and that was a repair
///
/// The scan used to select a file by `pub fn router(` and then look for
/// `rest::{module}::router(`. **One needle per module** — so a file's *second*
/// router was never given one, and `overlays::governance_router` (D-234's publish
/// route, the one mounted on `GovernanceState` apart from its siblings) was
/// outside the guard entirely. `api::rest::windows`' module doc had already
/// spelled out the rule this violates — *"a router named anything else is
/// precisely the hole this exists to close. One module, one router, one census
/// entry"* — and `windows` moved its whole module rather than grow a second
/// router for exactly that reason. `overlays` grew one anyway.
///
/// Nothing was broken when this was found: all four sites did merge it. But the
/// forcing function could not have told anyone otherwise, and the next second
/// router — mounted in `module.rs` alone, absent from `census()` and from
/// `registered_paths`, so the set-equality check compares two sets that both lack
/// it — would reproduce 2026-08-04 exactly, with every guard green. So the scan
/// now enumerates **every** `pub fn …router(` in each file and needles each by its
/// own name.
