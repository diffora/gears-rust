//! The plan revision chain against a real database.
//!
//! Everything worth proving here is a property of a **statement**, not of a
//! branch in Rust. The compare-and-swap is a conjunction the database evaluates
//! under the row lock, the row-version bump rides inside it, and the partial
//! `UNIQUE` indexes decide what "the current revision" and "the open draft"
//! even mean. A mock would assert that the repository's own `if` fires and
//! would keep asserting it after the predicate that matters had been deleted.
//!
//! The suite also pins the three-way refusal after a failed swap. A repository
//! that answered "conflict" to all three would send an operator into a retry
//! loop for the one case — a frozen revision — where no retry can ever succeed.

/// actually buys is a precise refusal taken before a write is wasted.
