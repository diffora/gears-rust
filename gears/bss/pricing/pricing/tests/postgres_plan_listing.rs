//! `plan_repo::list_authoring_page` on Postgres: one row per plan, and the row
//! is the one an **author** is holding.
//!
//! Why this suite is on the Postgres tier rather than the `SQLite` one: what it
//! proves is an interaction between an `ORDER BY` over two columns, a `LIMIT`
//! and the two partial `UNIQUE` indexes that bound how many rows a plan can
//! contribute — `uq_pricing_plan_current` and `uq_pricing_plan_open_draft`. The
//! indexes are what make the collapse's over-fetch sufficient, and they exist
//! as partial indexes only on the engine that has them.
//!
//! The listing deliberately does **not** answer with `current_tokens()`.
//! `LifecycleState::is_current_revision` is `Published | Retired`, so a plan
//! whose only revision is the draft somebody is authoring right now has no
//! current revision at all — and that is exactly the plan an authoring UI most
//! needs to see. `plans.rs::authoring_revision` already decides the rule for one
//! plan; this is the same rule over a page.
//!
//! Ignored by default; they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p cf-gears-bss-pricing -- --ignored`.
