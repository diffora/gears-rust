//! `POST /bss-pricing/v1/plans/{planId}/supersessions` over the real router
//! (`inst-su-api`, `inst-su-return`, D-88).
//!
//! What this suite owns that `sqlite_supersession_unit.rs` cannot: the **wire**. The
//! service-level suite drives `SupersessionService` directly and can say nothing about
//! the status code, the `outcome` token, which half of the view is null on which arm, or
//! whether the `{planId}` segment is checked against the row it names.
//!
//! The gate itself is not asserted here. `rest_authz.rs`'s census carries this route, so
//! `every_route_asks_the_catalogued_pair`, `a_pdp_outage_fails_closed_on_every_route` and
//! the deny properties all range over it — one set of gate properties for every route
//! rather than a per-suite copy free to be the weaker one.
//!
//! The commit arms here really do commit: `Harness` supplies a working
//! `RegistryDouble`. That is worth stating because the *deployed* gear has no
//! `CatalogVersionRegistryV1` implementation anywhere in this repository — it boots with
//! `UnconfiguredCatalogVersionRegistryV1`, so a commit arm exercised against a running
//! stand answers **503** at the version request. Nothing in this file asserts anything
//! about that stand; the sentence is here so a reader does not take these 202s as
//! evidence about one.
