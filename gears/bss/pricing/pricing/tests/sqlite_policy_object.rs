//! The per-tenant authoring policy, from the row all the way to the rule that
//! enforces it (D-152) — against a real database, not a mock.
//!
//! Two things are worth proving here and neither can be proved one layer up.
//! The first is the clause that keeps the ratified numbers from moving: a tenant
//! with **no** policy row is governed by the launch values, and a mock returning
//! a hand-built policy would assert that promise against a value the test itself
//! wrote. The second is that a cap and a required descriptor key travel from the
//! row into the pipeline: the caps are held as rule **fields**, so a resolution
//! that read the right row and then built the rule from the deployment default
//! would look correct at every layer and reject nothing a tenant configured.
//!
//! The pipeline is run whole rather than the two rules called directly. A rule
//! that resolved correctly and was never registered enforces nothing, and the
//! registration is the half a policy read cannot see.
