//! **Every snapshot in the corpus describes a row that would actually publish.**
//!
//! The corpus is the conformance contract between this catalog and Rating, and
//! a case pins what a row costs — or what publish does with it — by describing
//! the row. So a snapshot the catalog would refuse is a specification of an
//! **impossible row**: it teaches both gears the arithmetic of something that
//! can never be published, and it teaches it in the one artifact whose whole
//! purpose is to be the agreed reading.
//!
//! It also breaks the cases quietly rather than loudly. A publish pair authored
//! short stops at the first row-shape rejection and the guard the case exists to
//! test is never reached — that is exactly how five `supersession-continuity`
//! pairs sat green-looking against `EVAL_POLICY_MISSING`. An evaluation case
//! cannot fail that way at all, because no evaluator runs the publish rules:
//! nothing anywhere was checking the rows those cases describe. This test is
//! that check.
//!
//! It lives gear-side because only the gear has the rules
//! (`price_row_rules`, `design/03-price-structure.md`). `bss-fixtures` cannot
//! run them — it is the crate a gear takes as a production dependency, and the
//! corpus's standing invariant is that no evaluator, and no gear's rule set,
//! reaches it.
//!
//! ## The one row that is *supposed* to be refused
//!
//! A publish case asserting `rejected` with a **row-local** code specifies a
//! successor the catalog must refuse — refusing it is the whole content of the
//! case. So for such a case the successor is permitted to carry **exactly that
//! code and nothing else**; every other violation on it, and every violation on
//! the predecessor, is a finding as before.
//!
//! The invariant read as universal until 2026-08-08 only because every
//! `rejected` case in the corpus rejected through the **pair** guard, which this
//! test does not run — so no successor had ever legitimately failed the row
//! rules. Slice 10's `consumption-on-level-rejected` is the first that does
//! (`LEVEL_RESERVATION_CONSUMPTION_FORBIDDEN` is a row rule), and it exposed the
//! unstated premise rather than breaking the invariant. Narrowing to "exactly
//! the asserted code" rather than "any violation on a rejected case" is what
//! keeps the test's teeth: a successor that fails for a *different* reason is
//! still specifying an impossible row, and is still the way five
//! `supersession-continuity` pairs once sat green-looking.
//!
//! ## Why the shape rules and not the whole validator
//!
//! The row-shape pipeline is asked of **one row**; the publish validator is
//! asked of a **pair**, and half the corpus's snapshots have no pair. Running
//! the shape rules directly is therefore the only form of the question every
//! snapshot can answer, and it is the one the pair guard presupposes anyway:
//! the validator runs shape first precisely because a comparison between two
//! rows only means something once both would have been accepted on their own.
//!
//! The projection used here is [`validator::slice3_row`], which does **not**
//! apply the validator's unrepresentable-field gate. That gate declines a
//! snapshot carrying a field the gear cannot hold — `proration_basis`, and the
//! Slice-10 reservation pair — and declining is right when the question is
//! "what does publish do with this row". It is wrong here: those fields belong
//! to other slices, the Slice-3 rules have nothing to say about them, and the
//! Slice-3 *part* of a `proration` or `reserved` snapshot is still a row whose
//! shape must hold. Excusing those two families would exempt eight of the
//! corpus's twenty-seven cases from the rule this test exists to enforce.

#![allow(clippy::expect_used, clippy::unwrap_used)]

// Only the snapshot -> row projection is used here; the pair guard and the
// report helpers are `corpus_publish.rs`'s business. Re-authoring the
// projection in this file would create a second place for the corpus and the
// gear to disagree about what a row is, which is the failure the corpus exists
// to prevent.
