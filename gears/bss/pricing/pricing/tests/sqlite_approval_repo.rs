//! The approval repository against the executed `SQLite` mirror.
//!
//! Three operations and one gate. `open` writes a pending record, `read` finds
//! it under the tenant that owns it and **only** that tenant, and `decide`
//! performs the one flip §4 sanctions. What makes this a database suite rather
//! than a unit test is the second half of each: the record read back is the row
//! the store actually holds, the foreign scope is refused in SQL rather than by
//! a `WHERE` clause this file wrote, and the refusals are the ones the trigger
//! and the CHECKs produce.
//!
//! **Every refusal test first puts the world in the state where the object under
//! test is what answers.** A decision refused because the record was never
//! written is not evidence about `inst-as-immutable`.
