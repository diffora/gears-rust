//! The one-transaction contract, over a real store.
//!
//! `idempotency_repo`'s module doc rests everything on a sentence: `claim` and
//! `record_response` "MUST run inside the same transaction as the mutation they
//! guard", because split across two "the claim commits while the mutation does
//! not, and every retry of a request that never happened is answered 'already
//! done', forever." Until this suite that was an argument. Here it is an
//! observation: a mutation that fails inside the seam leaves **no claim row**,
//! so the retry claims afresh.
//!
//! Everything is asserted against rows rather than against return values where
//! the two could disagree — a replay that quietly re-ran its mutation would
//! still return the stored body, and only the row count says it did not.
