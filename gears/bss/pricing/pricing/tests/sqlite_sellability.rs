//! The sellability surface over **stored** deltas: §4.4's resolution rule, and
//! the property that a frozen version never changes what it answers.
//!
//! None of this is provable without a database. `delta_at` is a statement about
//! which of several rows answers a pin — the greatest `catalog_version <= V` whose
//! `warm_completed` is set — and about a tenant boundary that only a compiled
//! scope evaluates. A unit test could assert the query was built; it could not
//! assert that a consumer pinned to yesterday's version still reads yesterday's
//! coverage, which is the whole of what a pinned read model is for.
//!
//! The payload reader itself is proved without a database, beside the reader, in
//! `src/infra/storage/repo/read_model_repo_tests.rs`: it is a pure function of one
//! row, and rendering a delta and reading it straight back is the sharper
//! statement.
