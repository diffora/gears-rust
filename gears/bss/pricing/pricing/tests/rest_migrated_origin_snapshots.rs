//! Synthesis end to end, and `GET
//! /bss-pricing/v1/migrated-origin-snapshots/{subscriptionRef}` over the wire

//! `inst-sy-surface`, `inst-sy-firstrating`, D-76, D-81, D-87, D-102).
//!
//! The domain suite proves the **rule** — tier order, the fail-closed clause, the
//! trigger tokens. What only this file can prove is the **reader**: that tier 1
//! actually finds the `pricing_price` row whose window covered `t`, and that it
//! stops finding it on the other side of the interval. Those are properties of a
//! query over real windows, and no unit test over hand-built candidates can see
//! them — a reader that ignored `effective_from` entirely would pass every case
//! in `domain::synthesis`.
//!
//! # The covering window is the publish path's own, and that was a finding
//!
//! This file first seeded one with `rest_support::seed_window`. Every case
//! reddened with `WindowOverlap` — a **driver** refusal rather than an assertion,
//! which is the signal that a guard exists that the fixture did not know about.
//! It does: `Harness::publish_price` already schedules `[2099-08-04,
//! 2099-09-01)` on the published row, so the extra open-ended window collided
//! with it on the same canonical scope key. The fixture uses the real one
//! instead. Both instants below are therefore facts about a window the
//! production path created, not about one the test invented, and neither ages -
//! `rest_support`'s standing rule is that fixture windows are dated 2099 so no
//! wall clock reaches them and no activation sweep moves them.

/// The coverage inversion this file is, closed at one assertion. Nearly every
/// case here calls `h.governance.synthesis.synthesize(...)` directly and asserts
/// `frozen.record.payload` — the value the *service* stored, not the value the
/// *route* serves — so every "the frozen payload carries X" claim in this file
/// would pass against a read handler that filtered, renamed or projected a member
/// on the way out. That is a real risk on this surface and not a theoretical one:
/// the payload is a free-form `serde_json::Value` with no DTO between the store and
/// the wire, so nothing types the shape a consumer receives.
///
/// Comparing the whole document is what makes this one case stand in for all
/// fourteen: any projection, at any depth, in any member, fails here.
