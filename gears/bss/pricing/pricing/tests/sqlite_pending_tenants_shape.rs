//! The **shape** of the read `catalog_version_ref_repo::pending_tenants` issues,
//! counted rather than reasoned about.
//!
//! The warm sweep opens every pass with this call, at `readmodel_warm_tick_secs`
//! (5s by default), and enumerates up to `pending_tenants_per_pass` (250) distinct
//! tenant ids. It did so as a loose index scan: one `find().limit(1)` per tenant
//! found, each asking for the smallest tenant id above the last. So a deployment
//! with 250 tenants mid-publish paid 250 round trips every five seconds *before*
//! the two pending reads per tenant and the registry calls — the largest single
//! contributor to the pass outrunning the 5-second lease TTL it holds.
//!
//! # Why this is a whole test binary of its own, with exactly one test in it
//!
//! The claim is "how many statements", and nothing in the repository surface
//! reports that. `DBRunner` is sealed, so a counting runner cannot be written;
//! `sqlx` logs every statement it executes as a `tracing` event on the
//! `sqlx::query` target, and that is the only observation point. It has to be a
//! **global** subscriber — `sqlx_sqlite` runs each statement on the connection's
//! own worker thread, so a thread-local dispatcher installed by the test sees
//! nothing — and a global counter is fed by whatever else runs in parallel. One
//! test, one process, one counter: the first draft of this file had three tests and
//! the counted one read **17** where the shape it measured issues 13, because the
//! sibling cases' own reads landed in the same counter.
//! `tests/sqlite_overlay_world_fanout.rs` is the same arrangement for the same
//! reason and this file follows it. The three claims are therefore three **phases**
//! of one case, the counted one first.
//!
//! # Why twelve tenants and not two
//!
//! A probe over one or two tenants cannot tell the two shapes apart: the paged read
//! issues one statement for a page and a second to learn the page was the last,
//! which is also what the per-tenant walk spends on two tenants. Twelve makes the
//! difference unmistakable — thirteen statements for the walk (one per tenant plus
//! the empty one that ends it) against two for the page — and the assertion is
//! written against the seeded tenant count rather than against a literal, so
//! growing the seed cannot make it agree with the shape it refuses.
