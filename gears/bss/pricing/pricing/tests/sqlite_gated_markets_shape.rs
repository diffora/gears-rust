//! The **shape** of the read `price_repo::gated_markets` issues — that it is
//! bounded, and that bounding it did not change the number it answers.
//!
//! This was the one read on any of the three tickers with no `.limit()` at all: a
//! `price::Entity::find()… .all(runner)` over every published, non-grandfathered,
//! tax-inclusive row in the catalog, every 60 seconds, deduplicated into markets
//! afterwards. Its stated bound was *"the cost is bounded by the thing being
//! measured — the gated rows **are** the backlog"*, and that is not a bound: the
//! backlog is every tax-inclusive row every tenant has published, which the PRD's
//! own risk table sizes at *"an estimated eight months"*.
//!
//! # What is asserted, and why it is the statement text
//!
//! The claim is *"no unbounded read on a ticker"*, and the only observable that
//! distinguishes a bounded read from an unbounded one is the statement itself: a
//! paged shape and an unpaged one can return the same rows and the same count.
//! `sqlx` logs every statement on the `sqlx::query` target, so the probe reads the
//! `SELECT`s this call issues against `pricing_price` and requires each to carry a
//! `LIMIT`. A statement count would be the wrong measure here and would move the
//! wrong way — paging *adds* statements — which is why this file counts them only
//! to prove the page actually broke.
//!
//! # Why the page size is a parameter
//!
//! Proving the pages compose needs a seed that spans more than one page, and the
//! production page is 1000 rows — a seed nobody wants to write through
//! `create_draft`. So the walk takes its page size as an argument
//! ([`price_repo::gated_markets_in_pages`]) and the production entry point spends
//! the constant, which is the arrangement `gated_markets`' own `tax_engine_ga`
//! parameter already uses for the same reason: a value reasoned about in prose and
//! reachable from no test is a value the next reader has to re-derive.
//!
//! One test, one process, one counter — `tests/sqlite_overlay_world_fanout.rs`
//! states why a global subscriber cannot share a binary, and this file inherits it.
