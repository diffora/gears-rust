//! The supersession unit's serialization point, on real Postgres.
//!
//! # Why this cannot be a `SQLite` suite, and why it is owed
//!
//! `sqlite::memory:` **serializes writers**, so the interleaving under test can be
//! neither confirmed nor refuted there. `tests/sqlite_supersession.rs` proves that the
//! four writes land in one order and roll back together; what it cannot show is what
//! happens when two commits on one key are **in flight at the same time**.
//!
//! It is owed because `infra::supersession` chose a write order between the two planes on
//! a stated ground that a 2026-08-05 review showed to be false. The review also pointed
//! out that the unit has a **serialization point** nobody had recorded — and that it is a
//! better basis for choosing the order than anything written down.
//! `window_repo::refuse_overlap` documents at length that it has none; this suite shows
//! that the *commit* does, on the predecessor **price row**, one statement in.
//!
//! # The choreography, and why each step is there
//!
//! A concurrency test that starts two tasks and asserts on the outcome is a coin toss
//! with a green side. This one is driven by observable events only, in the idiom
//! `tests/postgres_approval_race.rs` established:
//!
//! 1. the first commit runs all four of its writes and then **parks**, holding the row
//!    lock on the predecessor's price row;
//! 2. the second commit starts; its reads see the still-committed `published` row, and
//!    its `UPDATE` blocks on that lock;
//! 3. a third connection **observes the block** in `pg_locks`, which is what proves the
//!    second commit's read already happened;
//! 4. only then is the first released to commit, and the second's `UPDATE` re-evaluates
//!    its `lifecycle_state = 'published'` predicate under READ COMMITTED, matches
//!    nothing, and resolves into the refusal.
//!
//! Step 3 is the load-bearing one. Without it the second commit could read the
//! *already-superseded* row and be refused by its own precondition before ever
//! contending — green, and about nothing.
//!
//! # What this proves about the ordering, precisely
//!
//! The two commits are a **replay of one unit** — same ids, same presented act counter —
//! which is the realistic race here (a retry after a timeout, a double approval) rather
//! than two operators inventing the same changeover.
//!
//! **This suite is what decided the write order between the two planes.** Run against
//! windows-first, the loser blocks on the predecessor *window* and is answered
//! `StaleRowVersion`, which sends an operator to re-read a window entity tag that is not
//! what changed. Run against rows-first, it blocks on the predecessor *price row*, finds
//! it `superseded`, and is answered `NotSupersedable`, whose message names the actionable
//! remedy. The order is free for correctness, so diagnosis is what is left to choose on —
//! and this case is the measurement, not a restatement of it. Reorder the two pairs in
//! `commit_supersession` and this assertion flips.
//!
//! Ignored by default; it needs Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_supersession_race -- --ignored`.
