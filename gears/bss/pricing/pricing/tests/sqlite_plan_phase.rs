//! `pricing_plan_phase` against a real database — the constraints, the
//! append-only triggers, and the repository that writes through them.
//!
//! Everything worth proving here is a property of the **schema** or of a
//! **statement**, not of a branch in Rust. The partial `UNIQUE` that admits one
//! terminal phase per revision, the CHECK that stops `display_trial_days`
//! drifting from its source, and the three triggers that freeze a phase row when
//! its revision publishes are all evaluated by the engine; a mock would assert
//! that the repository's own `if` fires and would keep asserting it after the
//! predicate that matters had been deleted.
//!
//! The suite carries **two** harnesses on purpose. The constraint and trigger
//! cases drive raw SQL through `common::migrated_db`, because the states they
//! need — a phase row under a published revision, a phase row under an abandoned
//! one — are states no typed path will ever produce and the guards exist
//! precisely for what reaches the table outside this gear. The closing cases
//! drive `PlanShapeRepo`, because what they prove is the repository's: which
//! refusal a caller is told, and what is left behind afterwards.
//!
//! Postgres mirrors every CHECK, index and trigger here as one PL/pgSQL trigger
//! function and the same objects, so the guards need no testcontainers case; see
//! the migration's module doc for the transform.
//!
//! **The key's scope is the exception, and is proved on both engines.** D-340
//! widened the primary key, and the two arms of `pricing_plan_phase` are not one
//! rule spelled twice: Postgres names the key as a droppable constraint and
//! `SQLite` reaches it only by rebuilding the whole table, so the mirror's green
//! says nothing about the canonical engine. `tests/postgres_schema_plan_shape.rs`
//! carries the Postgres half of the acceptance and `tests/postgres_migrations.rs`
//! proves the rebuild's Postgres counterpart applies over rows that already exist.
