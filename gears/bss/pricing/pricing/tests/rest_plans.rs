//! The plan plane, driven through the real router.
//!
//! `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot` over the router `register_rest` mounts, so the
//! extractors, the PEP gate, the repositories and the response serialization are
//! all in the path — the same harness `tests/rest_frontier.rs` established, over
//! a migrated in-memory `SQLite`.
//!
//! Two habits run through every case here and both are deliberate. A denial
//! asserts **403 and an unchanged database**, because a 403 alone would also be
//! produced by a handler that wrote first and checked second — "the authz gate
//! before the repository" is only a claim about source order until somebody
//! observes the store. And a refusal asserts its **discriminator**, never only
//! its status: §3.3 makes the code the one a consumer matches on, and several
//! distinct refusals share one status. Where the refusal mints no code -
//! `DomainError::InvalidRequest` renders `invalid_argument` with no `reason`,
//! which is D-141's shape and the majority of this door's 400s - the
//! discriminator is the canonical family plus the guard's own sentence, and
//! [`refused_by`] is what asserts it.
