//! What the **store** refuses of a `migrated-origin` record — Slice 11's frozen
//! snapshot (`design/11-lifecycle.md` §6, `inst-sy-provenance`, `inst-sy-freeze`,
//! `inst-sy-select`, `inst-sy-payload`, D-76, D-81, D-87, D-102), driven as raw
//! SQL because what is under test is the store's own guarantee and not any
//! repository's use of it.
//!
//! # Why a suite at all, when the table is already written in production
//!
//! `synthesis_repo::freeze_or_load` writes it and `rest_migrated_origin_snapshots`
//! drives that path end to end — and neither can see any rule here stop
//! refusing. A repository only ever offers **legal** values: its `NewProvenance`
//! carries a typed `Trigger`, a resolved set it built itself and a payload it
//! materialized, so every statement it emits satisfies all four `CHECK`s by
//! construction. A suite driving the repo catches a constraint that got
//! *narrower*; it is blind to one that got dropped, which is the failure mode
//! this gear denounces and the reason every rule below is driven past the
//! repository.
//!
//! Until this file the table appeared in the whole test tree **only** in the two
//! migration censuses, which pin names and digests and run no statement.
//!
//! # What the frozen arms cost the rest of the suite, stated rather than found
//!
//! Every `CHECK` here is reachable **only on `INSERT`**. There is no legal
//! `UPDATE` of this table at all — `trg_pricing_snapshot_provenance_no_update` is
//! unconditional and fires before any constraint is evaluated — so a case that
//! tried to move a row into an illegal shape would be answered by the trigger and
//! would prove nothing about the constraint it named. The absence of such cases
//! below is structural, not an oversight.
//!
//! # Where this arm and its Postgres twin genuinely differ
//!
//! `postgres_schema_snapshot_provenance` proves the same roster on the engine
//! that ships. Two differences are real rather than cosmetic, and each is pinned
//! on the side that has it:
//!
//! * **`json_valid` is load-bearing here and has no Postgres counterpart.** The
//!   mirror's `resolved` and `payload` are `text`, so a writer can put anything
//!   at all in them and the first conjunct of each shape `CHECK` is what refuses;
//!   on the shipping engine the columns are `jsonb` and the **type** refuses the
//!   same statement before any constraint runs.
//! * **The one PL/pgSQL function is two triggers here**, because `SQLite` has no
//!   `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE`. Two arms are two things to lose, so both are
//!   driven separately below.
