//! The price-history read (`inst-he-read`) against the executed `SQLite` mirror.
//!
//! Every claim this suite makes is a claim about what a **query** returns, which
//! is why none of it is a unit test. The walk's order is an `ORDER BY` over two
//! columns and not an in-memory sort of rows this file happened to hand over;
//! the cursor's resume is a `WHERE` the database evaluates; the actor is a column
//! read out of `pricing_price`; and the effective dating is a second table joined
//! by id. A page assembled from a vector would assert that the assembly compiles.
//!
//! # The fixture's two orders disagree on purpose
//!
//! The four seeded rows are laid out so that `price_id` order and authoring order
//! are **completely different** — the earliest row carries the largest id and the
//! latest carries the smallest. That is the whole content of "chronological":
//! `PriceRepo::list_for_plan_page` already walks `price_id ASC`, and a history
//! read that inherited it would be green against a fixture whose two orders
//! happened to agree, while returning a price history in an order nobody
//! authored anything in.
//!
//! # Two rows share one instant, and that is not an edge case
//!
//! `created_at_utc` is the request's instant, and a publish unit, a clone and a
//! repricing run each write several rows at one of them. So a tie is the normal
//! case rather than a curiosity, and it is what decides whether the keyset
//! predicate is written correctly: a walk resuming on the instant alone skips the
//! rest of a tied group, and one resuming on `>=` returns the cursor's own row
//! again on every page. The suite walks the whole history one row at a time,
//! which is the only page size at which both mistakes are visible.
//!
//! # Why one row is authored and three are seeded
//!
//! `PriceRepo::create_draft` writes an audit record; a direct `price::Entity`
//! insert writes none. Mixing them is what makes the actor case say something:
//! D-12's 2026-07-28 amendment puts the history record's actor on the row's own
//! `created_by` and forbids `pricing_audit_log`, and a fixture in which every row
//! had an audit record would be equally green either way, because the ordinary
//! authoring path stamps the same principal in both places. Here three of the
//! four rows have no audit record at all, so a read that consulted that table
//! would lose them.
