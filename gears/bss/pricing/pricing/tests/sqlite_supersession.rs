//! `inst-su-commit`'s writes, across **both** planes, against a real database.
//!
//! The row half is pinned one file over (`sqlite_price_repo.rs`): the predecessor's
//! flip and the successor's publish, and the order between them. What this suite is
//! for is the half that file cannot reach — the two **window** operations landing in
//! the same transaction as the two row operations, and the ordering *between* the
//! window operations, which is a second constraint of exactly the same shape as the
//! row one and is enforced by a different mechanism.
//!
//! A unit test over a composed plan could assert the four calls happen. It could not
//! assert that the third one fails when the second has not run, which is the only
//! property that makes the composition an order rather than a list.
//!
//! Every instant here is a **fixed** date. `inst-ws-future-start` and the changeover
//! floors both compare against a clock, so a fixture computed from `now()` is one
//! that asserts something different every day it runs; the suite's dates sit in 2099
//! so that "future" stays a fact, and the one case that needs a *past* window says so
//! at its own constant.
