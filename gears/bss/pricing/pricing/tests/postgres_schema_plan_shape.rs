//! `pricing_plan_phase`, `pricing_plan_addon_rule`,
//! `pricing_plan_descriptor_set` and `pricing_plan_period_floor_cap` — the four
//! revision-scoped children of a plan revision — proved by **executing the
//! statement each object must refuse**, on Postgres.
//!
//! # Why this suite exists
//!
//! `m20260802_000012`, `…000013` and `…000014` had never run on the backend they
//! target. `tests/sqlite_plan_phase.rs`, `tests/sqlite_plan_addon_rule.rs` and
//! `tests/sqlite_plan_descriptor_set.rs` prove the **mirror**, which is a
//! different set of objects: three fixed-message `RAISE(ABORT, …)` triggers per
//! table where Postgres has one PL/pgSQL function with two arms, and a `WHERE
//! NOT EXISTS` subquery in the trigger body where Postgres does a `SELECT …
//! INTO`. They also reach the tables through repositories, which is the layer
//! that cannot see a guard stop refusing.
//!
//! `tests/postgres_migrations.rs` closed half the remaining gap by pinning the
//! CHECK, trigger and partial-index rosters **by name**, so an object cannot
//! vanish unnoticed. It issues no DML, so it says the objects reached the server
//! and nothing about what any of them does. This suite is the other half for
//! these three tables: one executed refusal per object, and the assertion names
//! the object the refusal came from.
//!
//! # The three rules every test here follows
//!
//! **Execute the refusal.** A test that writes valid values is not evidence
//! about a guard. It catches a constraint that got *narrower* — the writer
//! starts failing — and never one that stopped refusing.
//!
//! **Put the world in the state where the object under test is what answers.**
//! Three separate hazards live on these tables and each of them was hit while
//! writing this file:
//!
//! * `uq_pricing_plan_phase_terminal` refuses a second phase with a NULL
//!   `converts_to_phase_id` under one revision, so every phase row below that is
//!   not *about* that index carries a successor and stays outside its predicate.
//!   Without that, the second `INSERT` of any multi-row test is answered by the
//!   index rather than by the constraint under test.
//! * `uq_pricing_plan_open_draft` on the **parent** refuses a second `draft`
//!   revision of one plan, so every draft parent here is a distinct plan.
//! * `chk_pricing_plan_addon_rule_required_max_qty` and
//!   `chk_pricing_plan_addon_rule_qty_range` overlap on a row that is both
//!   `required` and inverted, so each refusal moves exactly one column of an
//!   otherwise-valid row.
//!
//! **Assert the object, never the table.** Every CHECK, index, foreign key and
//! trigger message over these tables carries the table name, as does the column
//! list Postgres prints for a unique violation. A test that accepted any error
//! naming the table would pass with the guard it means to prove switched off.
//!
//! # The trigger has two arms and they overlap almost completely
//!
//! All three tables carry the same function shape:
//!
//! ```text
//! IF TG_OP <> 'INSERT' THEN  -- arm 1: the OLD parent must be a draft
//! IF TG_OP =  'DELETE' THEN RETURN OLD;
//!                            -- arm 2: the NEW parent must be a draft
//! ```
//!
//! On an ordinary `UPDATE` — one that leaves `plan_id` and `plan_revision`
//! alone — the OLD parent and the NEW parent are the **same row**, so arm 2
//! refuses everything arm 1 refuses and raises the identical sentence. Arm 1's
//! only unshared statement is therefore the **DELETE**, which arm 2 never sees
//! (it returns `OLD` above the second lookup). Arm 2's unshared statements are
//! the **INSERT** and the `UPDATE` that **re-points** a child row from a draft
//! revision onto a frozen one — the statement by which a frozen revision would
//! otherwise acquire a child without an INSERT ever being issued.
//!
//! The tests are split along exactly that line, so deleting either arm reddens
//! exactly one of them. The ordinary frozen-parent `UPDATE` is kept with arm 1,
//! which is what answers it in the intact schema; its assertion survives arm 1's
//! deletion (arm 2 catches it) and the DELETEs beside it do not.
//!
//! ## The missing-parent branch is shadowed by the foreign key
//!
//! Arm 2's `coalesce(parent_state, 'missing')` fires on an INSERT naming a
//! revision that does not exist — but so would
//! `fk_pricing_plan_phase_revision`. The trigger is `BEFORE` and the FK is
//! checked at end of statement, so the trigger is what *answers*; nothing is
//! reachable through that branch alone. It is exercised for the message rather
//! than claimed as a guard.
//!
//! ## And the foreign key is shadowed on every INSERT
//!
//! The mirror image: a child INSERT passes arm 2 only if the parent row exists
//! **and** reads `draft`, so by the time the FK is consulted its referent is
//! always there. The only statement the FK alone can refuse is a **parent** that
//! moves out from under its children — `UPDATE pricing_plan SET revision = …` on
//! a draft revision, which the parent's own trigger waves through because the
//! draft plane is where content moves. That is the statement each FK test below
//! executes.
//!
//! # Positives are load-bearing
//!
//! Every guard here is a whitelist rather than a blanket ban, so the suite
//! carries the accepting cases: all three phase kinds store, a revision holds
//! many phases beside its one terminal, a revision holds many add-on rules
//! (D-105's whole point), a descriptor set stores with every optional column
//! NULL, and INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE all run freely under a `draft` parent.
//! Without those a table nothing can be written to at all would pass.
//!
//! # Objects this suite deliberately does not test by refusal
//!
//! `idx_pricing_plan_phase_revision`, `idx_pricing_plan_addon_rule_revision` and
//! `idx_pricing_plan_descriptor_set_revision` are **non-unique, non-partial**
//! indexes. They refuse nothing; their only observable effect is on plan choice,
//! which is not a correctness property and would make a brittle test. Their
//! presence is pinned by name in `tests/postgres_migrations.rs`, and that is the
//! whole of what can be said about them here.
//!
//! Ignored by default; they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_schema_plan_shape -- --ignored`.
