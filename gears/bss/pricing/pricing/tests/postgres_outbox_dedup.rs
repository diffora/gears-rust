//! `pricing_outbox`'s deduplication refusal, measured on the engine that serves
//! it.
//!
//! # Why this belongs in the Postgres tier and not beside its `SQLite` twin
//!
//! A repeated announcement violates **two** constraints at one insert.
//! `outbox_id` is a `v5` digest of `(tenant_id, dedup_key)` and it is the table's
//! primary key, so `pricing_outbox_pkey` and `uq_pricing_outbox_dedup_key` have
//! the same operand and no input trips one without the other. Which of the two a
//! driver names is the engine's choice: Postgres checks in index OID order and
//! the primary key is created with the table, `SQLite` names the columns of
//! whichever it evaluated.
//!
//! `outbox_repo`'s recognizer decides the refusal class off that name, so the
//! `SQLite` cases in `sqlite_publish_commit` and `sqlite_bundle_publish` prove
//! the arm on one engine only — and the arm exists precisely to stop answering
//! `CONCURRENT_MUTATION`, whose remedy is a retry that rebuilds the same key and
//! collides identically. An engine that names the other index answers the exact
//! advice the arm removes, with every `SQLite` case green.
