//! idempotent on a client-supplied key, and the only externally visible part of

//! asserted "both succeed" would pass with the idempotency removed.
//!
//! The other thing proved only here is that **`DELETE` cancels**: the row is read
//! back afterwards and is still there, in `cancelled`. A route test that only
//! checked the status would pass against a handler that deleted the row, and an
//! executor re-reading a deleted schedule cannot tell it from one that never
