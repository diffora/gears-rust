//! `pricing_audit_log`, and the two concurrency claims the design set makes
//! about it — proved on real Postgres, because `SQLite` cannot answer either.
//!
//! `tests/postgres_migrations.rs` says the table's three CHECKs and its
//! append-only trigger reached the server; it issues no DML and is therefore
//! evidence of presence only. This suite is the other half: every guard answers
//! a statement written to trip it, and the assertion names the object the answer
//! came from.
//!
//! # Why this suite exists at all, and why it could not be a `SQLite` one
//!
//! `sqlite::memory:` **serializes writers**. Two of `audit_repo`'s CONTRACT
//! claims are statements about two writers running at once, so on the mirror
//! they can be neither confirmed nor refuted — not "probably fine", *unanswered
//! in both directions*:
//!
//! - **D-159.** Two mutations of the **same** aggregate contend on the primary
//!   key `(tenant_id, chain_id, seq)`; the loser takes a unique violation, its
//!   **whole transaction** rolls back, and it reaches a caller as
//!   `CONCURRENT_MUTATION` / **409** rather than as a 500. `sqlite_audit_chain.rs`
//!   proves the key's half by writing the occupied position directly — which is
//!   the collision *simulated*, not the collision *had*.
//! - **D-135.** Two mutations of **different** aggregates of one tenant both
//!   commit without contending on a chain head. This is the entire benefit
//!   segmentation bought: before it, one head serialized every audited mutation
//!   of a tenant inside its own mutation transaction, against a >= 50 rows/s
//!   repricing SLO. `05-governance.md` §9 lists it as an integration acceptance
//!   criterion. If it does not hold, the design's performance argument is void.
//!
//! Both are driven through [`audit_repo::append`] in two **real** concurrent
//! transactions. Neither is staged by writing a colliding row by hand: a
//! hand-written collision proves the constraint, and what is in doubt here is
//! the *scheduling*.
//!
//! ## How the race is made deterministic rather than hoped for
//!
//! A concurrency test that starts two tasks and asserts on the outcome is a coin
//! toss with a green side. Both races here are choreographed with observable
//! events only:
//!
//! 1. the winner's transaction appends and then **parks**, so its row exists and
//!    is uncommitted;
//! 2. the loser's transaction starts and appends — under READ COMMITTED its head
//!    read cannot see the winner's uncommitted row, so it targets the same
//!    position and blocks on the key;
//! 3. a third connection **observes the block** in `pg_locks` (`NOT granted`),
//!    which is what proves the loser's head read already happened;
//! 4. only then is the winner released to commit, and the loser's insert
//!    resolves into the unique violation.
//!
//! Step 3 is the load-bearing one. Without it the loser's head read could land
//! after the winner's commit, both would succeed, and the test would be green
//! about nothing. The D-135 test is the same choreography with the assertion
//! inverted: the second aggregate's transaction must **complete while the first
//! is still parked**, enforced by a timeout, so a mutation that contended would
//! hang and redden rather than quietly wait its turn.
//!
//! # What a Postgres suite has to do to be evidence
//!
//! Inherited verbatim from `tests/postgres_migrations.rs`, and each rule bit
//! here:
//!
//! **Prove a constraint by executing the statement it must refuse**, and assert
//! the error names that constraint. A suite that writes only valid rows catches
//! a constraint that got *narrower* and never one that stopped refusing.
//!
//! **Put the world in the state where the object under test is what answers.**
//! Every CHECK case below varies exactly one column of an otherwise-valid row,
//! so no neighbour can answer first.
//!
//! **Every guard must be provable by removal.** The mapping object → test is in
//! the group report; two of the objects here redden **two** tests each, and that
//! arity is deliberate rather than sloppy — `chk_pricing_audit_log_rollup` is a
//! biconditional with two independent arms, and the append-only trigger fires on
//! two different `TG_OP`s.
//!
//! # The chain's linkage: connectedness and content are two tests
//!
//! They are separated on purpose, and the reason is a Phase-2 defect worth not
//! repeating. `sqlite_audit_chain.rs`'s walk rebuilds each preimage **from the
//! stored columns it is checking**, so a writer that blanked `before_state` and
//! `after_state` would store NULLs, recompute over NULLs, and agree with itself:
//! the whole suite stays green while the record loses the two fields
//! `inst-au-complete` exists for. So here the expectation is built from the
//! values **this test handed to the writer**, and it is checked twice over —
//! once against the stored columns and once against the digest.
//!
//! Ignored by default; they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p cf-gears-bss-pricing --test postgres_audit_chain -- --ignored`.
