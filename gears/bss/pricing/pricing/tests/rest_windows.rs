/// the mounted surfaces at all"*, and this is the counterexample: every step through a
/// mounted route, no fixture reaching past them, ending in a **mutating** 202 on a
/// window of a key that held none. It grew a step when the schedule began consulting
/// the threshold policy — six calls now rather than three — and the step is D-10's own
/// two-person configuration act, so the sequence an operator performs is longer and
/// still contains no deadlock.
///
/// **Why the empty publish is not a trick.** `coverage::check` ranges over the
/// **billable** set, so a plan with no price row presents no key for
/// `inst-wc-required` to find uncovered, and `run_publish_rules` has no
/// minimum-row rule — a plan whose shape is sound publishes with an empty row set.
/// That is the state the sequence starts from, and it is asserted (`published`, with
/// `price_rows` empty — no row was frozen) rather than assumed, because the whole
/// argument rests on it.
///
/// This block sat above the `#[tokio::test]` of the test *beside* this one until
/// 2026-08-20 — a second doc attribute on a function that executes **one** publish
/// and makes no such assertion — so rustdoc showed two contradictory descriptions of
/// that case and none of this one.
///
/// What is **true**, and is the narrow statement the module doc now carries: the
/// billable row cannot ride the *first* publish, because at that moment its key holds
/// no window and no window can be scheduled on a plan with no current revision. So
/// the order is forced — publish, author, schedule, and the row rides the next
/// publish — and nothing about it is a deadlock.
