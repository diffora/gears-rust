//! `GET/PUT /bss-pricing/v1/config/tax-display-policy` — C4's enforcement mode,
//! driven through the real router (`design/04-currency-tax.md` §5, §6,
//! `inst-td-policy`; D-154).
//!
//! # Why this file exists (Z12-5)
//!
//! The surface had **no behavioural test at any tier**. The route was declared in
//! `module_test`'s path census and catalogued in `rest_authz`'s, and the only
//! request ever made to it was `rest_authz`'s own — a `PUT` under a deliberately
//! stale `If-Match`, so the handler was refused before it wrote and the assertion
//! was only that the status is not 401/403. Nothing read the `GET`, nothing
//! completed a `PUT`, and `grep -rn "TaxDisplayPolicy" tests/` returned nothing at
//! all.
//!
//! The consequence was one branch further in. `infra::publish` resolves the
//! tenant's mode and hands it to the rule set, so a tenant on `warn` publishes
//! under a rule arm that **no integration test at any tier had ever executed**:
//! every publish in the crate ran under `FailClosed`, and the `warn` branch of
//! `inst-td-policy` would have hatched with green tests the first time an operator
//! selected it.
//!
//! # The two arms are asserted together, because the switch is about the difference
//!
//! C4 reads as one switch and D-154 splits it: `warn` relaxes the **rate** arm — a
//! `taxInclusive` row in a region declaring no tax rate — and does not touch the
//! **category** arm, which blocks publish whatever the policy says because
//! `taxCategory` is a pinned D-48 v1 descriptor element. A suite proving only the
//! first would read as proof of a switch that relaxes everything, which is the one
//! way the module's own doc says this surface gets misread. So the category case
//! runs under **both** modes and is refused under both.
