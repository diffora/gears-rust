//! The seven standalone stores of `m20260802_000003`…`…000009`, proved by
//! **executing the statement each object must refuse**, on Postgres.
//!
//! `pricing_read_model`, `pricing_catalog_version_ref`, `pricing_pin_frontier`,
//! `pricing_policy_object`, `pricing_operator_flag`,
//! `pricing_idempotency_dedup` and `pricing_outbox`.
//!
//! # Why this suite exists
//!
//! None of these seven migrations had ever run on the backend they target: the
//! `SQLite` mirror was what every test reached, and a repository is what reached
//! it. A repository writes only legal values, so a test that goes through one
//! catches a constraint that got *narrower* — the writer starts failing — and
//! never one that stopped refusing. The Phase-2 review of `pricing_price` found
//! fourteen constraints that could each be replaced with `CHECK (1 = 1)` with the
//! whole crate green; nothing distinguishes these tables from that one except
//! that nobody had looked.
//!
//! `tests/postgres_migrations.rs` closed half the gap by pinning the CHECK and
//! partial-index rosters **by name**, so an object cannot vanish unnoticed. It
//! issues no DML, so it says the objects reached the server and nothing about
//! what any of them does. This suite is the other half: one executed refusal per
//! object, and the assertion names the object the refusal came from.
//!
//! # The three rules every test here follows
//!
//! **Execute the refusal.** A test that writes valid values is not evidence
//! about a guard.
//!
//! **Put the world in the state where the object under test is what answers.**
//! Four of these tables carry constraints that overlap on the same illegal
//! value, and each of them was hit while writing this file:
//!
//! * `chk_pricing_catalog_version_ref_version` is only reachable on a row that
//!   already satisfies `chk_pricing_catalog_version_ref_commit`, so the negative
//!   version has to arrive **with** a `committed_at`; a bare
//!   `catalog_version = -1` is refused by the co-nullability constraint and the
//!   test would be green while proving nothing.
//! * `chk_pricing_approval_threshold_absolute_non_negative` needs its own basis
//!   left as the only one set, or `chk_pricing_approval_threshold_basis` answers
//!   first. (It replaced a pair on `pricing_policy_object` with the same overlap;
//!   `m20260802_000018` dropped both columns when the threshold moved to its own
//!   versioned, per-currency table.)
//! * `chk_pricing_idempotency_dedup_status` needs a `response_body`, or
//!   `chk_pricing_idempotency_dedup_answered` answers.
//! * `uq_pricing_outbox_sequence` and `uq_pricing_outbox_dedup_key` cover the
//!   same table and would each refuse a naive duplicate row; every collision
//!   below therefore moves exactly one of the two keys and leaves the other
//!   distinct.
//!
//! **Assert the object, never the table.** Every CHECK and index over these
//! tables carries the table name, as does the constraint name Postgres prints
//! for a unique violation. A test that accepted any error naming the table would
//! pass with the guard it means to prove switched off.
//!
//! # There are no triggers here, and that is a decision each migration argues
//!
//! Not one of these seven tables carries an append-only trigger, and the reasons
//! differ table by table rather than being an omission: `pricing_read_model` is
//! a **projection** and the projector rebuilds its rows on a degraded-publish
//! re-drive, with the frozen-content guarantee enforced upstream on the truth
//! tables; `pricing_pin_frontier` is a **watermark** and is meant to be updated,
//! its one forbidden direction — backwards — being the repository's guarded
//! `WHERE catalog_version < :to`, which a whitelist trigger could not express
//! better; `pricing_operator_flag` clears a flag by **deleting the row**, because
//! a `cleared` tombstone would make "is this subject divergent" a question about
//! the newest of several rows. So this suite has no trigger arm to execute, and
//! the absence is recorded here rather than read as a gap.
//!
//! # Positives are load-bearing
//!
//! Two of them carry more weight than the rest and are worth naming:
//!
//! * **Two refs of one tenant may resolve to one `catalog_version`.** The table
//!   used to carry `uq_pricing_catalog_version_ref_version`, and under D-47
//!   batching that index refused the normal case — the registry batches approved
//!   publishes, so a version legitimately bundles several. The index is gone and
//!   its replacement is non-unique; this test is what would redden if somebody
//!   restored the bijection.
//! * **Every optional column of `pricing_policy_object` may be absent.** Every
//!   default there is the fail-safe one and the nullability *is* the encoding: an
//!   absent rounding policy means every published row must carry its own, and an
//!   absent cap means the ratified launch value. A `NOT NULL` slipped onto any of
//!   them would change a fail-safe default into a required configuration. The
//!   threshold is no longer among them — an absent **entry** is now an absent row
//!   in `pricing_approval_threshold`, which is where `inst-mat-percurrency`'s
//!   per-currency fail-safe reads it.
//!
//! # Objects this suite deliberately does not test by refusal
//!
//! `idx_pricing_read_model_resolve`, `idx_pricing_catalog_version_ref_version`,
//! `idx_pricing_operator_flag_by_flag`, `idx_pricing_idempotency_dedup_created`
//! and `idx_pricing_outbox_undrained` are **non-unique** indexes, the last of
//! them partial. A non-unique index refuses nothing; its only observable effect
//! is on plan choice, which is not a correctness property and would make a
//! brittle test. Their presence is pinned by name in
//! `tests/postgres_migrations.rs`, and that is the whole of what can be said
//! about them here.
//!
//! Ignored by default; they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_schema_stores -- --ignored`.
