//! `pricing_price` and `pricing_price_tier_band`, proved by **executing the
//! statement each object must refuse**, on Postgres.
//!
//! # Why this suite exists
//!
//! A Phase-2 review of `m20260802_000002` found that **fourteen** of this
//! table's CHECK constraints could each be replaced with `CHECK (1 = 1)` with
//! the whole crate green. Nothing was broken: the repository writes only legal
//! values, so every test that reached these columns reached them through a
//! writer that could not produce an illegal one. A suite built that way catches
//! a constraint that got *narrower* — the writer starts failing — and never one
//! that stopped refusing.
//!
//! `tests/postgres_migrations.rs` closed half of the gap by pinning the CHECK,
//! trigger and partial-index rosters **by name**, so a constraint cannot vanish
//! unnoticed. It issues no DML, so it says the objects reached the server and
//! nothing about what any of them does. This suite is the other half for these
//! two tables: one executed refusal per object, and the assertion names the
//! object the refusal came from.
//!
//! # The three rules every test here follows
//!
//! **Execute the refusal.** A test that writes valid values is not evidence
//! about a guard.
//!
//! **Put the world in the state where the object under test is what answers.**
//! A refusal an *earlier* guard produced is not evidence about the guard the
//! test names. This table makes the hazard concrete: twenty CHECKs share one
//! row, and several of them fire on the same illegal value. `package_size = 0`
//! trips `chk_pricing_price_package_size` only on a row whose `model_kind` is
//! already `package`; on any other kind
//! `chk_pricing_price_package_fields_kind` answers first and the test would be
//! green while saying nothing about the constraint it names. Every refusal
//! below is therefore an otherwise-**valid** row with exactly one column moved.
//!
//! **Assert the object, never the table.** Every CHECK, index and trigger over
//! these two tables has `pricing_price` in its name, as does the column list
//! Postgres prints for a unique violation. A test that accepted any error
//! naming the table would pass with the guard it means to prove switched off.
//!
//! # Positives are load-bearing
//!
//! Every guard here is a whitelist rather than a blanket ban, so the suite
//! carries the accepting cases too: the valid row lands, a draft row is
//! deletable, `published -> superseded` is taken, a `grandfather_until` may be
//! *tightened*, a draft and its published predecessor share a scope key, and a
//! band set with gaps, overlaps and a closed top is stored without complaint.
//! Without those a table nothing can be written to at all would pass.
//!
//! # Two objects this suite deliberately does not test by refusal
//!
//! `idx_pricing_price_plan` and `idx_pricing_price_supersedes` are **non-unique**
//! indexes — the second partial. A non-unique index refuses nothing; its only
//! observable effect is on plan choice, which is not a correctness property and
//! would make a brittle test. Their presence is pinned by name in
//! `tests/postgres_migrations.rs`, and that is the whole of what can be said
//! about them here.
//!
//! Ignored by default; they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_schema_price -- --ignored`.
