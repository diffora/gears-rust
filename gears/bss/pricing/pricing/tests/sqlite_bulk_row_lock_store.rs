//! What the **schema** refuses of a bulk row lock — Slice 12's side table
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §6, `inst-bk-lock`, `inst-bs-commit`,
//! `inst-bs-approval`, D-37), driven as raw SQL because what is under test is
//! the store's own guarantee and not any repository's use of it.
//!
//! Two of this table's three rules are about *when* a lock may exist, and the
//! third is the absence of a rule: `DELETE` is unguarded, because release has to
//! work from the ordinary completion, from D-37's operator abort, and from a
//! janitor cleaning up after a crash. A guard there would freeze interactive
//! authoring exactly when a run has died holding rows, which is the failure the
//! release path exists to prevent.
