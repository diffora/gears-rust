//! The retirement orchestrator (`inst-rt-cancel`, `inst-rt-event`,
//! `inst-re-governed`, D-109, D-128, D-182).
//!
//! `sqlite_cutover_unit`'s shape, because the two acts are the same shape of
//! thing: an always-material unit that a single principal may compose and may
//! not commit. What differs is what the act *is* — a cutover stages two rows and
//! moves three windows, a retirement stages nothing and, in this system, moves
//! nothing at all.
//!
//! That last clause is the reason this file exists rather than a route test
//! standing in for it. D-182 makes the D-79 presence lane absent, D-131's
//! fail-closed clause then reads every key as occupied, and retirement keeps
//! every scheduled window. The distance between "keeps every window because the
//! rule says so" and "cancels nothing because nobody wired the loop" is not
//! visible from a green suite — it is visible from a preview that says *why*
//! each window was kept, and from a cancellation loop that runs over an empty
//! list rather than not existing.
