//! What the **schema** refuses of a repricing journal row — Slice 12's
//! idempotency spine (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §6, `inst-mr-journal`,
//! `inst-mp-journal`, O3), driven as raw SQL because what is under test is the
//! store's own guarantee and not any repository's use of it.
//!
//! The journal is what makes a crashed run safe to re-drive, so every rule here
//! is about one of the two ways a re-drive can go wrong: applying a row twice,
//! or skipping a row that was never applied. The second is the quiet one — a
