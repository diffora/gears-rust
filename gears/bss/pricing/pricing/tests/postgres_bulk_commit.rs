//! Phase 2's per-row optimistic commit **on the engine that runs in production**
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §3 `inst-bk-phase2`, §4 `inst-bi-commit`,
//! `inst-bk-lock`, `inst-bs-done`; D-141, D-290, D-291, D-294).
//!
//! `sqlite_bulk_commit` drives [`commit_batch`] against the mirror and, until
//! this file, was the only place it ran at all. Two of its properties are not
//! provable there:
//!
//! **The holder in a conflict.** [`commit_batch`] takes its locks on
//! `db.conn()` — an autocommit connection — because `take_locks` requires one:
//! Postgres aborts an enclosing transaction on a failed statement, so inside one
//! the read that names the holding run cannot happen and the refusal degrades
//! from `BulkRowLocked` to a bare storage error. `SQLite` does not abort on a
//! failed statement, so its version of
//! [`a_row_another_run_holds_conflicts_the_whole_batch`] passes whether or not
//! that contract is honoured. Here it does not: a `commit_batch` that moved its
//! locking inside a transaction would take the degraded error down the
//! `Err(other)` arm, fail the run outright, and redden this suite while every
//! `SQLite` suite stayed green. `postgres_bulk_repo` pins the degradation
//! directly.
//!
//! **A run-level failure that is not any row's.** `commit_rows` treats four
//! refusals as per-row conflicts and everything else as the run's, and the run's
//! must still land terminal with its locks released — `inst-bs-done` says the
//! lock is released "either way", and D-294 is the commit where a `?` on
//! `commit_rows` made that false. Reaching that arm needs a store refusal the
//! domain types do not screen out first; `chk_pricing_price_billing_timing` is
//! one, and this engine names it in the message.
//!
//! Every case asserts **both halves** of the receipt, for
//! `sqlite_bulk_commit`'s reason: a receipt naming only the failures would be
//! satisfied by a run that committed nothing, and one naming only the successes
//! by a run that silently dropped the rest.
//!
//! Run with:
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_bulk_commit -- --ignored`.
