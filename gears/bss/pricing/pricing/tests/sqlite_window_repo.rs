//! The window repository against the executed `SQLite` mirror.
//!
//! What makes this a database suite rather than a unit test is the half of each
//! operation a unit test cannot have: the row read back is the row the store
//! actually holds, the foreign scope is refused in SQL rather than by a `WHERE`
//! clause this file wrote, and the canonical scope key on every record is
//! resolved out of `pricing_price` rather than restated here.
//!
//! # This is where non-overlap is proved, and it is proved nowhere else
//!
//! §6 puts non-overlap per canonical scope key "inside every mutation" because no
//! constraint can reach it: the key is ten columns of `pricing_price` and none of
//! them is on the window row. So the rule has no schema object, `tests/postgres_window.rs`
//! cannot execute a statement that trips it, and this suite carries the whole
//! proof.
//!
//! **The statement only non-overlap can refuse** is
//! [`an_overlapping_window_is_refused`]'s: two windows on one key at `[t1, t3)` and
//! `[t2, t4)` with `t1 < t2 < t3 < t4`. That shape is chosen and not incidental —
//! see the test's own doc. Every refusal test here first puts the world in the
//! state where the object under test is what answers.
//!
//! # Why the price rows are seeded through their entity rather than authored
//!
//! `pricing_price` rows are written with `price::Entity::insert` rather than through
//! `PriceRepo::create_draft`, and deliberately: this suite needs a `superseded`
//! predecessor and a `published` successor **on one canonical scope key**, which is
//! the state a supersession leaves behind and which no authoring path in this gear
//! can currently produce. Composing it out of the writers that exist would mean
//! asserting the window rules against a world those writers can build rather than
//! against the world §6 is about. The insert still goes through the tenant gate, so
//! the seeding cannot fabricate a row the scope would not admit.
