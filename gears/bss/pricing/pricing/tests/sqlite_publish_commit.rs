//! The publish commit as a whole, against a real database.
//!
//! `design/01-foundation.md` §4.2 step 4 is five moves in one transaction, and
//! what this suite proves is the "one transaction" half: after a success the
//! database holds exactly five artifacts, and after **any** failure it holds
//! none of them. A unit test over the service could assert the calls happen; it
//! could not assert that a failure three statements in undoes the two before it,
//! which is the only property that makes a publish atomic.
//!
//! # The G5/G6 seam is asserted here, deliberately
//!
//! Every success case asserts `pricing_read_model` is **empty** and
//! `pricing_pin_frontier` is **untouched**. Those two assertions are the seam:
//! the commit holds a *pending* handle and no version number, and
//! `pricing_read_model` is keyed `catalog_version NOT NULL`, so a delta row is
//! not even expressible here. They are the tests that fail if G6's work ever
//! leaks backwards into this one.
//!
//! # The registry double, and why it may never leave this file
//!
//! The only registry this crate can have in production is
//! `UnconfiguredCatalogVersionRegistryV1`, because the registry gear has no code
//! in this repository — so the **fail-closed arm is the only arm the real wiring
//! can reach**, and the success path needs a double. It lives in the test crate
//! and must never move into `src/`, not even as a "development" default: the
//! single failure this port exists to prevent is a second incrementer shipping,
//! and a default that invents versions locally is exactly that. The double also
//! asserts the idempotency the commit depends on — two calls carrying one
//! `request_id` return one handle — because that is what makes a rolled-back and
//! retried commit re-request rather than orphan.

/// what makes the digest the only variable: same plan, same revision, same rows,
/// same `row_version` everywhere, and an authorization carrying a pin that no
/// longer matches what the commit re-derives. Staging a *mutation* instead would
/// move a `row_version`, and the compare-and-swap would answer `STALE_VERSION`
/// whether or not the pin is bound to anything — which is the trap this staging
/// exists to avoid.
///
/// **This doc used to describe a different staging** — a unit opened over one
/// draft and a commit aimed at a second plan's identically-shaped draft — which
/// the body never performed. The prose was left over from an abandoned attempt;
/// the behaviour proved is the stronger of the two, because a corrupted pin
/// isolates the check from every other guard in the commit.
///
/// # What this does **not** exercise, said plainly
///
/// The in-transaction re-derivation is driven here only against a **corrupted
/// authorization**, never against a world that actually moved between the
/// decision and the commit. There is no test anywhere that stages the latter,
/// and the reason is structural rather than an omission of effort: the publish
/// route looks an approval up by subject **and content**
/// (`approval_repo::find_approved_for_content`), so a subject that moved after
/// the approve has no approved unit and never reaches `commit` at all — that
/// path is `rest_publish::a_row_edited_after_the_approve_does_not_publish_under_
/// the_stale_decision`, and it ends in a fresh 202. The only way to reach the
/// re-derivation with a genuinely moved world is the approve→commit race, where
/// the mutation lands after the route's lookup and before the commit's
/// transaction, and nothing in this crate stages it. What is proved here is that
/// the check is bound to the digest; that it is bound to the *current* world is
/// carried by `infra::publish`'s placement of the re-derivation inside the

/// **A ranked plan that another published plan points at still publishes** —
/// D-258's second owed case, and the one that was a live wrong answer rather
/// than a silent gap.
///
/// D-54's reverse guard reads the subject's `comparability_rank` off the shape
/// and the inbound edges off the store, independently. While `assemble_from`
/// never copied `change_contract`, the shape's rank was `None` on every publish
/// while the edges were real — so `COMPARABILITY_RANK_REVOKED` fired against
/// **any** plan another published plan named, however carefully that plan had
/// authored its rank. An operator was refused for a rule they satisfied, and
/// their remediation — publish a rank — could not work.
///
/// So this case asserts a **publish**, not a refusal. That is the awkward shape
/// and it is the necessary one: the defect made a passing subject fail, and only
/// a green subject with a real inbound edge can see it.
