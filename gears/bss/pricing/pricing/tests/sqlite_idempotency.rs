//! The at-most-once gate against a real database.
//!
//! The gate is a `PRIMARY KEY` and an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so
//! there is nothing here a mock could observe: every assertion below is about
//! what the *statement* did — which insert the key swallowed, which UPDATE
//! matched the row as it was read, which `CHECK` refused a half-recorded
//! answer. A test double would keep passing after the conflict clause had been
//! deleted.
//!
//! The suite drives [`ClaimOutcome::InFlight`] directly rather than through
//! concurrency, on both paths that reach it. On `SQLite` a race cannot be staged
//! anyway — one writer, transactions serialized — so a racing test would prove
//! nothing while looking like it proved everything. What is worth pinning is
//! that an unanswered claim is *reported* rather than answered with a response
//! nobody was ever given. The takeover half of that, which needs a caller
//! holding a row the store has already moved past, is pinned beside the module
//! in `src/infra/storage/repo/idempotency_repo_tests.rs`, since no sequence of
//! public calls can produce a stale read.
