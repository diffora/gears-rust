//! The gear's half of the joint conformance corpus: the publish cases, and the
//! generated `registry.toml` they earn a flag in.
//!
//! This file is the **single authority** on the committed registry's content.
//! `bss-fixtures-conformance` can compute only one of the two halves the file
//! records — it cannot reach the gear, by the corpus's own invariant — so an
//! expectation built there would be an expectation over a registry with the
//! publish half nailed shut. Two crates each asserting a different expected
//! content is how a generated file starts flapping.

/// Every publish case the gear does not answer as the corpus states, pinned.

/// **The disagreement is the product.** The corpus and the gear are two
/// independent readings of one design set, so where they differ a human decides
/// which is wrong — the expected value is never adjusted to make a run pass, and
/// neither is the rule. This list therefore exists to be *loud*: it fails the
/// moment either side moves, which is exactly when the decision is due.
///
/// It is empty, and each entry was closed by deciding which side was wrong:
///
/// - `price-change-accepted`, `unit-change-rejected`, `kind-flip-rejected`,
///   `carry-allowance-change-rejected`, `package-size-change-rejected` — the
///   gear answered `EVAL_POLICY_MISSING`. **The gear was right and the corpus
///   was under-authored.** None of those successors carried
///   `tierAggregationWindow`, which `inst-tb-window` requires on every tiered
///   usage row and `inst-pk-window` (D-58) on every `package` usage row. They
///   were authored as *deltas*, but the publish question is asked of a whole
///   row, and a row that would not publish on an empty key does not publish on
///   an occupied one either. Fixed in the corpus: both sides of each pair now
///   carry the window, equal, so the guard's subject is unchanged.
/// - `consumption-on-level-rejected` — the gear cannot assess it at all: the
///   snapshot carries the Slice-10 reservation pair and `PriceRow` is the
///   Slice-3 shape. **The corpus was right and the gear is not there yet**, so
///   neither side moved. The corpus now *says* so, with `declined_until` on the
///   case — the `trailing-tier` treatment at case granularity — and a decline is
///   therefore the anticipated answer rather than a disagreement. The verdict
///   stays authored and stays checked; see the two tests below.
