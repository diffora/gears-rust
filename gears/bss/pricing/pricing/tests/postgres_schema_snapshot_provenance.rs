//! Slice 11's frozen `migrated-origin` record **on the engine that runs in
//! production** (`design/11-lifecycle.md` §6, `inst-sy-provenance`,
//! `inst-sy-freeze`, `inst-sy-select`, `inst-sy-payload`, D-76, D-81, D-87,
//! D-102).
//!
//! # The largest hole the rule census found, and why the writer that exists did
//! not close it
//!
//! `synthesis_repo::freeze_or_load` writes this table in production and
//! `rest_migrated_origin_snapshots` drives that path end to end — and neither can
//! see a rule here stop refusing. A repository only ever offers **legal** values:
//! `NewProvenance` carries a typed trigger, a resolved set synthesis built itself
//! and a payload it materialized, so every statement it emits satisfies all four
//! `CHECK`s by construction. Driving the repo catches a constraint that got
//! *narrower*; it is blind to one that was dropped. Until this pair the table
//! appeared in the whole test tree only in the two migration censuses, which pin
//! names and digests and run no statement.
//!
//! `sqlite_snapshot_provenance_store` proves the same roster on the mirror, and
//! that is not the same thing: the frozen guard is **one PL/pgSQL function with
//! two arms** here against two `RAISE(ABORT, …)` triggers there, and only the
//! `SQLite` side carries a trigger-**body** digest census — so a lost arm on the
//! shipping engine was invisible to every gate. That is the standing half of the
//! debt D-260 records, closed for this table.
//!
//! # What only this arm can prove, and what only the mirror can
//!
//! Postgres names the constraint in the error, so every case below asserts by
//! **name** — `uq_pricing_snapshot_provenance_subscription` and
//! `pricing_snapshot_provenance_pkey` are distinguishable here where the mirror
//! can only read back which columns it listed.
//!
//! The mirror's `json_valid` conjunct has no counterpart here and its absence is
//! the point: `resolved` and `payload` are `jsonb`, so the **type** refuses
//! malformed input one layer below any constraint. The case that drives it below
//! asserts the type's own refusal, so the two files read as one roster rather
//! than one of them appearing to be missing a rule.
//!
//! # Every `CHECK` here is reachable only on `INSERT`
//!
//! Stated rather than left to be rediscovered: the frozen function raises on
//! **every** `UPDATE`, before any constraint is evaluated, so no statement can
//! move a row into an illegal shape and be answered by a `CHECK`. The absence of
//! update-into-illegal cases below is structural.
//!
//! Run with:
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_schema_snapshot_provenance -- --ignored`.
