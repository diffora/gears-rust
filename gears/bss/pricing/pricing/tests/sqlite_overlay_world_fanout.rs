//! The **shape** of the reads `OverlayRepo::world_for` issues, counted rather
//! than reasoned about.
//!
//! `overlay_facts` reads every published overlay of the tenant — the validation
//! genuinely needs the whole set, so that read is unbounded by design (§4.2) —
//! and then reads each one's lines. The defect this suite exists to keep out is
//! the *second* fan-out: one amounts query **per line**, which made the number of
//! round trips inside the publish transaction a function of the tenant's total
//! line count rather than of its overlay count.
//!
//! # Why this is a whole test binary of its own
//!
//! The claim is "how many statements", and nothing in the repository surface
//! reports that. `DBRunner` is sealed, so a counting runner cannot be written;
//! `sqlx` logs every statement it executes as a `tracing` event on the
//! `sqlx::query` target, and that is the only observation point. It has to be a
//! **global** subscriber — `sqlx_sqlite` runs each statement on the connection's
//! own worker thread, so a thread-local dispatcher installed by the test sees
//! nothing — and a global counter shared with the rest of a test binary would be
//! fed by whatever else runs in parallel. One test, one process, one counter.
//!
//! A probe over one overlay with one line could not tell the two shapes apart:
//! both issue one amounts query. So the seed is **three published overlays of
//! four lines each**, where the per-line shape issues twelve amounts reads and
//! the per-revision shape issues three, and the assertion names the number of
//! revisions rather than a literal.
