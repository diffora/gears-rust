//! The mass-repricing apply's own atomicity and idempotency, **on the engine
//! that runs in production** (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §3
//! `inst-mr-apply`, `inst-mr-validate-scope`; D-134).
//!
//! # Why this exists as its own suite
//!
//! `tests/sqlite_repricing_apply.rs` drives [`apply_run_in`] over an in-memory
//! `SQLite` database and its own module doc says exactly what that engine
//! cannot speak to: `SQLite` serialises writers and — the fact this suite
//! exists to close — **does not abort a transaction on a failed statement**.
//! `postgres_bulk_commit.rs:10-21` says the identical thing about its own
//! sibling: `SQLite`'s version of the conflict case there "passes whether or
//! not that contract is honoured." `apply_run_in`'s own module doc
//! (`src/infra/repricing.rs`) leans on the same fact from the other side —
//! plan B's aggregate-pass failure has to roll back **every write the row
//! loop just made in that same transaction**, and a `SQLite` connection that
//! keeps going after a failed statement cannot tell a real rollback from a
//! partial commit nobody noticed. This suite is the one place that
//! distinction is load-bearing rather than academic.
//!
//! # What this suite ports, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! `sqlite_repricing_apply.rs` proves five properties over `apply_run_in`.
//! Two of them are engine-differential and are ported here:
//!
//! * **The per-plan transaction is atomic under a real aborting engine.** A
//!   run spanning two plans where the second plan's aggregate pass fails:
//!   plan A applies whole, plan B applies none of its rows, and every one of
//!   plan B's journal rows reads `failed` with the one shared reason
//!   `apply_by_plan`'s catch-all writes. On `SQLite` a failed statement
//!   inside plan B's transaction does not necessarily undo what came before
//!   it in the same transaction; on Postgres it does, unconditionally — this
//!   is the property `SQLite` cannot refute, only fail to contradict.
//! * **Re-run idempotency over a journal a real rollback left behind.** A
//!   second `apply_run_in` call over the same run — now carrying both
//!   `applied` and `failed` rows, the `failed` half having survived a genuine
//!   engine-level rollback rather than a `SQLite` connection that merely kept
//!   going — applies nothing twice and answers the identical [`RunOutcome`].
//!
//! The other three are **not** ported:
//!
//! * `inst-mp-grandfathered` clauses 1 and 2 (the selector's structural
//!   exclusion, and the per-row refusal of an explicitly-selected
//!   grandfathered row) are pure application logic — `RunSelector::admits_grandfathered`
//!   and `price_repo::refuse_unsupersedable_class` read no engine-specific
//!   behaviour at all, and `sqlite_repricing_apply.rs`'s three cases already
//!   prove them. Porting them here would be coverage of the mirror wearing a
//!   different connection string, not coverage of the engine.
//! * The bulk lock's `Drop`-guard release on a genuinely cancelled future
//!   (`sqlite_repricing_apply.rs`'s `a_future_dropped_mid_apply_releases_its_bulk_lock_and_lands_the_run_terminal`)
//!   is [`Drop`]'s own language guarantee, which fires identically regardless
//!   of what pool sits under it — `RunLockGuard`'s own doc is explicit that
//!   what it promises and does not promise is about Tokio and the process,
//!   not about the database engine. What *would* be engine-specific — whether
//!   an aborted-but-never-explicitly-rolled-back transaction's connection is
//!   returned to a real two-connection pool cleanly enough for the guard's own
//!   detached recovery task to acquire one — is a real question this suite
//!   cannot safely answer without being able to run it: getting a timing
//!   budget or a polling loop wrong against a shared two-connection Postgres
//!   pool (`pg_support`'s own cap, chosen because one server now carries every
//!   suite's pools at once) risks a flake or a deadlock in a job that runs on
//!   every merge, for a property that is not the one this task was scoped to
//!   close. Left for a task that can execute it.
//!
//! # Why the seed goes through the real publish writers, not a bypass
//!
//! `postgres_clone_atomicity.rs`'s own seed publishes past the engine
//! (`common::publish_row_directly`/`publish_plan_directly`) for a stated
//! reason: that suite's subject is the clone, and a fixture routed through
//! the publish pipeline would make a pipeline failure read as a clone
//! failure. That reason does not hold here. `apply_run_in`'s own aggregate
//! pass reads the plan's *current* revision and its rows' lifecycle state
//! back through `plan_repo::load_current`/`price_repo::load_for_plan` —
//! exactly what a real publish leaves behind — and `plan_repo::publish_revision`/
//! `price_repo::publish_rows` are the same generic, engine-dispatched
//! functions `sqlite_repricing_apply.rs` already seeds through. Using them
//! here rather than a raw `UPDATE` keeps this suite's only engine-specific
//! surface exactly where the module doc above says it is: inside
//! `apply_run_in` itself, not in how the fixture got its rows to `published`.
//!
//! Run with:
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_repricing_apply -- --ignored`.
