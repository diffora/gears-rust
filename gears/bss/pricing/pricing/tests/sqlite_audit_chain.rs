//! The segmented audit chain against a real database.
//!
//! What a chain is for is that somebody can walk it years later and recompute
//! every link. So the load-bearing test here is the **re-walk**: read a
//! segment's rows back out of the columns that stored them, rebuild each
//! record's canonical encoding, and check the digest the writer put in
//! `row_hash`. A test that only asserted "a hash was written" would keep passing
//! after the encoding and the store had stopped agreeing.
//!
//! **And here is the limit of that, stated because it is easy to misread
//! (measured 2026-08-04, while building the Postgres suite).** The re-walk
//! rebuilds each preimage **from the stored columns**, so it is evidence about
//! *connectedness* and about the encoding — never about *content*. Blank
//! `before_state` and `after_state` in both the hashed record and the stored row
//! and this suite stays **fully green**: it is self-consistent by construction,
//! because the data it checks is the data it derives its expectation from. That
//! is the Phase-2 G8 defect exactly, still live here, and the reason
//! `tests/postgres_audit_chain.rs::every_row_holds_the_record_its_writer_was_handed_and_hashes_to_it`
//! exists — it asserts the content against an independently constructed
//! expectation and names the field. **Connectedness and content need different
//! tests, and the second never substitutes for the first.**
//!
//! # What is owed, and what **kind** of thing each item is
//!
//! An earlier version of this list said "unproven and owed to a Postgres suite"
//! of five properties at once. That was wrong about three of them, and the
//! wrongness was not cosmetic: one entry — "the isolation the publish
//! transaction is opened with behaves as its CONTRACT claims" — was not a claim
//! awaiting evidence at all. It was checkable by reading two lines of this
//! crate's own code together, and it was **false**. Filing it as owed-to-Postgres
//! converted an argument that could have been finished into a debt nobody would
//! collect, and that is how a live concurrency defect stayed hidden. So each
//! entry now says what it is.
//!
//! 1. **Unprovable here.** Two concurrent mutations of *different* `chain_id`s
//!    of one tenant both commit without contending on a chain head. This is the
//!    entire benefit D-135 bought — before segmentation one head serialized every
//!    audited mutation of a tenant inside its own mutation transaction — and
//!    `05-governance.md` §9 lists it as an integration acceptance criterion.
//!    `sqlite::memory:` serializes writers, so nothing here can observe it.
//!    Fairly owed to a Postgres suite.
//! 2. **Undemonstrated, not unproven.** Two mutations of the *same* aggregate
//!    serialize rather than fork. Both halves of the mechanism are already
//!    established: the key half by
//!    [`a_second_row_at_one_position_is_refused_by_the_primary_key`] below, and
//!    the rollback half by `in_transaction`'s own contract. What Postgres would
//!    add is the concurrent *demonstration*, not the guarantee — so listing the
//!    whole property as unproven overstates the gap.
//! 3. ~~**Unimplemented, and owed to a decision rather than to a suite.**~~
//!    **Both halves paid, and this entry had gone stale in two directions**
//!    (corrected 2026-08-04). The decision arrived first — D-159 named the class
//!    `CONCURRENT_MUTATION`, and the insert has routed through
//!    `contention_or_db` since, so "the refusal stays `RepoError::Db`" was
//!    already false when written; this file's own comment block further down was
//!    up to date while this one was not, so the file disagreed with itself. The
//!    suite arrived on 2026-08-04:
//!    `tests/postgres_audit_chain.rs::the_loser_of_a_same_segment_race_is_a_retriable_contention`
//!    drives two real transactions to the collision and asserts the whole ladder
//!    through to the 409.
//! 4. **Was false, and is now corrected.** "The isolation level the publish
//!    transaction is opened with behaves as its CONTRACT claims" used to sit
//!    here. The CONTRACT's key argument was sound and its predicate conclusion
//!    was not, and the gap it left is closed by the per-row version guard in
//!    `price_repo::publish_rows` — a predicate on a statement, provable here and
//!    proved. What remains genuinely unobservable is only that `SQLite` cannot
//!    distinguish one isolation level from another, which is a statement about
//!    the backend rather than a debt.
//! 5. **Half already proven; the other half is a cost measurement.** The
//!    registry round-trip inside an open transaction. Its *failure* behaviour is
//!    proven by `registry_absence_stops_the_publish_and_writes_nothing` in
//!    `tests/sqlite_publish_commit.rs`. Only its *cost* — what holding a network
//!    call inside a transaction does to a real connection pool — is owed, and
//!    that is a load test rather than a correctness suite.
//!
//! The template for item 1 is
//! `gears/bss/ledger/ledger/tests/postgres_chain.rs`, whose
//! `concurrent_posts_form_linear_chain` is the shape it wants. It is owed by
//! whichever group first stands a Postgres suite up.
