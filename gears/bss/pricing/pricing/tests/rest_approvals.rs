//! The approval surface, driven through the real router: the reviewer's queue,
//! the record D-61 binds, and the three decisions.
//!
//! # The positive control comes first, deliberately
//!
//! Five rules share one decision path and four of them can fire on a request
//! built carelessly, so every refusal below is staged as **one move away from**
//! [`an_independent_principal_approves_and_the_record_says_who`]. Without that
//! world, a service that refused everything would satisfy the whole file.
//!
//! # The publish route is what opens a unit, and this suite uses it
//!
//! There is no submit endpoint on the approval surface — §5's four rows are the
//! queue, the record and the three decisions — so a unit is opened the way an
//! operator opens one, by publishing a publishable plan. Reaching for
//! `ApprovalService::submit` instead would test the decisions against a record
//! no surface can produce.
