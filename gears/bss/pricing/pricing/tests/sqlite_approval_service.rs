//! The approval workflow against a real database: the two-person rule, the
//! approver's scope, the mandatory reason, the TOCTOU void and the pin's
//! re-verification.
//!
//! # Every refusal here first puts the world in the state where the guard it
//! names is what answers
//!
//! Five checks share one decision path, and four of them can fire on a request
//! built carelessly. So the suite opens with
//! [`an_independent_reviewer_approves_the_content_they_were_shown`] — the world
//! in which every refusal below is a fact about the rule it names rather than
//! about a service that refuses everything — and each refusal moves exactly one
//! thing away from it.
//!
//! # The void is asserted per **surface**, because that is what it depends on
//!
//! `inst-ap-pin`'s correctness is a property of a *set* of mutating surfaces,
//! not of one mechanism: a surface that forgets to void is a reviewer approving
//! content that moved, and nothing about the guard itself would look wrong. So
//! there is one test per surface that must void, and one for the surface that
//! must **not** — `create_plan`, which cannot touch a subject pinned before the
//! plan existed. The full enumeration with its reasoning is in
//! `infra::approval::void_pending_units_of`'s doc.
//!
//! One of those surfaces is not on the void's rail and was missing from both the
//! enumeration and this file until 2026-08-04: `open_revision` appends its own
//! audit record, so it inherits nothing, and
//! [`opening_the_successor_revision_voids_the_unit_the_publish_orphaned`] is its
//! test. Its staging is the only one here that reaches a plan without passing
//! the rail at all, which is what lets it show a residue nothing else closes.
//! The publish commit itself closes its own since 2026-08-04
//! (`tests/rest_publish.rs`); this one is the backstop's test, and its staging
//! says so.
//!
//! # How the content mismatch is staged, and why not by mutating the subject
//!
//! The obvious staging — submit, mutate the plan, approve — **cannot reach the
//! mismatch**, and that is the guard working: the mutation voids the record
//! first, so the approve is answered `APPROVAL_NOT_PENDING`. What
//! `APPROVAL_CONTENT_MISMATCH` guards is the residue: a subject that moved
//! without passing the void rail at all.
//!
//! That residue is staged by opening a record whose pin does not match the
//! subject, with **nothing else different** — no row touched, no
//! `row_version` moved anywhere in the plan. This is the Phase-2 G7 lesson
//! applied: staging two revisions at different versions would let a plain
//! compare-and-swap answer 409 whether or not the pin is bound to anything, and
//! the test would prove nothing. Here every version coincides, so the pin is the
//! only thing that can produce the refusal.
//!
//! The other half of the evidence is elsewhere and is named so a reader can
//! follow it: that the *recomputed* digest tracks the content is
//! `domain::approval::content_pin`'s
//! `every_hashed_field_moves_the_pin`, and that an unmoved subject recomputes to
//! its pin is the positive control at the top of this file.
