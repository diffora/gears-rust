//! `GET /bss-pricing/v1/audit`, driven through the real router — S5 §5's Auditor
//! read (`inst-au-read`; D-12, D-125, D-135, Z13-8).
//!
//! # What this suite is really about
//!
//! `infra/error_mapping.rs` justifies dropping the detail from three 403 arms
//! because the attempt "is already on `pricing_audit_log` as a `deny` record
//! carrying that id — a durable trail rather than a log line". Until this route
//! existed, nothing an operator can reach could read that record: the only reader
//! in the tree was `rest_support::audit_rows`, a **test-side** query over the
//! table, which is exactly why the gap was invisible to a green suite.
//!
//! So the first case does not assert "the route returns rows". It reproduces the
//! refusal the ladder names, through the router, and then reads the compensating
//! record back **through the route** — the id, the actor, the verb and the code —
//! because that pairing is the claim, and a page of rows is not.
//!
//! Every case here reads through the mounted route and asserts on the response
//! body. Where a case needs to know what the store holds, it says so and uses
//! `audit_rows` as the *independent* answer to compare the route against; a suite
//! that only compared the route to itself could not tell a page that dropped
//! records from a store that never had them.
