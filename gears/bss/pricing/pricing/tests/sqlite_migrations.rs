//! The migration chain — the Foundation tables and the slice-owned ones that
//! follow them — exercised end to end on an in-memory `SQLite`.
//!
//! Three properties, each a real boot failure mode:
//!
//! 1. **Completeness, and agreement with the entities** — after `up`, every
//!    table can be read through its `SeaORM` entity. That is a stronger check
//!    than "the table exists": `SeaORM` names every column in the `SELECT`, so
//!    a migration and an entity that disagree about a column fail here rather
//!    than at the first production read.
//! 2. **Re-run safety** — a second boot over the same database applies nothing
//!    and skips everything. The sibling ledger carries a whole Postgres
//!    regression for the version of this that bit it (bookkeeping landing in the
//!    wrong schema made every migration re-run and a non-`IF NOT EXISTS`
//!    `CREATE TABLE` abort in a crash loop); the cheap half of that check
//!    belongs in the fast suite.
//! 3. **Reversibility** — `down` then `up` round-trips, so a rollback leaves a
//!    database the chain can walk forward again rather than a half-dropped one.
//!    This one introspects `sqlite_master` directly, because it is also where
//!    the shared `coord_leases` table (spliced in for the singleton warm
//!    re-drive) is checked; `coord` does not export its entity.
//!
//! 4. **The object census** — every trigger and every index the chain creates, by
//!    name, in both directions. That is a fourth property rather than a detail of
//!    the first: a table can exist with its guards missing, and on the backend the
//!    in-crate suite actually runs, a **dropped trigger or index changes nothing
//!    any application-level test can see**. Deleting
//!    `uq_pricing_approval_key_pending` or any of the register's `RAISE(ABORT)`
//!    triggers left the whole suite green — the contention tests are answered by
//!    `approval_repo::find_pending_key_holder`, which is a `SELECT` — so the rule
//!    silently degraded from a constraint to a check. The census is what makes that
//!    a red test.
//!
//! Postgres-backed coverage is testcontainers-gated by convention in this repo
//! and none is added: the append-only guards are mirrored onto `SQLite` as
//! `RAISE(ABORT, ...)` triggers, so `sqlite_append_only.rs` exercises them with
//! no Docker.

// database, so every rebuild in the chain has only ever dropped an empty parent
// table and every tightened CHECK has only ever been applied to a table with no
// rows. That is the one state a deployed database is never in, and it is the
// state three of these migrations were measured to fail in.
//
// **What this section can still say changed when the chain was squashed, and the
// banner outlived it.** It promised cases that "stage the chain at one migration,
// write the rows, and then apply it", while all three below applied
// `&name_ordered_chain()` — the whole chain onto an empty database — and inserted
// afterwards: the exact shape the paragraph above contrasts itself with. Measured
// at this commit, no `up` arm in the chain carries a `DROP TABLE`, a `RENAME TO`,
// an `ALTER TABLE` or an `INSERT`: every one of the 42 is a pure create, each
// table is created **once** with every CHECK and every trigger inline, and the
// three re-authoring migrations the paragraph above refers to are not separate
// steps any more. So there is no state in which one of these tables exists and the
// guard under test does not, and a case cannot be written to reach one.
//
// What is still expressible is the other half of the same claim, and it is what
// [`staged_to`] does: apply the chain **as far as the migration that creates the
// table**, write the rows there, then apply the **remainder** over a populated
// database. Every later create then runs against a schema holding rows — its
// foreign keys resolve against occupied parents rather than empty ones — which is
// the state a deployment is always in and no case above this line reaches. Each
// case asserts its rows survived the remainder and re-asks its refusal afterwards,
// because a remainder that silently dropped the row it was applied over is the
// failure this shape has.
