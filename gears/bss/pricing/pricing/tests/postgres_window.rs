//! `pricing_price_window`, proved by **executing the statement each object must
//! refuse**, on Postgres.
//!
//! # What this suite is for
//!
//! `tests/postgres_migrations.rs` pins this table's CHECKs, its function and
//! its trigger **by name**, so none of them can vanish unnoticed. It issues no
//! DML, so it says the objects reached the server and nothing about what any of
//! them does — a CHECK replaced by `CHECK (1 = 1)` keeps that suite green. This is
//! the other half: one executed refusal per object, and each assertion names the
//! object the refusal came from.
//!
//! Every statement here is raw SQL, deliberately past every repository, because
//! the repository is exactly the layer that cannot see a guard stop refusing.
//!
//! # The three rules every test here follows
//!
//! **Execute the refusal.** A test that writes valid values is not evidence about
//! a guard.
//!
//! **Put the world in the state where the object under test is what answers.**
//! This table makes the hazard concrete twice over. The trigger has five arms and
//! several of them refuse many of the same statements: `expired -> active` is
//! refused by the terminal-history arm *and* by the transition arm, so a test
//! using it would prove nothing about either. Each test below therefore issues the
//! statement **only its own arm** can refuse, and each test's doc says which
//! shadow it was written to escape.
//!
//! **Assert the object, never the table.** Every CHECK and both triggers over this
//! table carry `pricing_price_window` in their name, as does the Postgres message
//! for a foreign-key violation. A test that accepted any error naming the table
//! would pass with the guard it means to prove switched off.
//!
//! # What this suite cannot prove, and where that proof lives
//!
//! **Non-overlap, and it is now half declarative.** Since D-352 the chain carries
//! `excl_pricing_price_window_no_overlap` — an `EXCLUDE USING gist` over
//! `(tenant_id, price_id, tstzrange(effective_from, effective_to, '[)'))` where the
//! state is `scheduled` or `active`, on the `btree_gist` extension
//! `m20260821_000002` installs — mirrored on `SQLite` as
//! `trg_pricing_price_window_no_overlap_insert`/`_update`. That covers two windows
//! on **one `price_id`**, and
//! [`a_second_overlapping_window_on_one_key_is_refused_by_the_store`] below
//! executes it.
//!
//! What stays procedural is the other half: one canonical scope key carried by
//! **two different `price_id`s**. The key is ten columns of `pricing_price` and
//! none of them is on the window row, so no index on this table can reach a
//! sibling row's interval; `window_repo::refuse_overlap` is where that half lives,
//! and `tests/sqlite_window_repo.rs::an_overlapping_window_is_refused` is its
//! proof.
//!
//! `idx_pricing_price_window_price` and `idx_pricing_price_window_due` are
//! **non-unique** indexes and refuse nothing; their only observable effect is on
//! plan choice, which is not a correctness property. Their presence is pinned by
//! name in `tests/postgres_migrations.rs` and that is the whole of what can be said
//! about them.
//!
//! Ignored by default; they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p cf-gears-bss-pricing --test postgres_window -- --ignored`.

///
/// A Postgres exclusion constraint does not refuse a conflicting inserter while
/// its rival is still open: it makes it *wait* on that transaction's id until the

/// and the shape this case first landed in — T1 parked until `release`, `release`
/// notified only after T2's verdict had been read — was a **harness deadlock**
/// with no database fault under it. Measured on the harness rather than reasoned

/// # The sibling this case exists to stop being a sibling
///
/// [`a_second_overlapping_window_on_one_key_is_refused_by_the_store`] above proves
/// the recognizer on `window_repo::schedule`'s INSERT. Wiring
/// `window_repo::overlap_or` into that door **and into no other** leaves it short,
/// because
/// `pricing_price_window` has three writers — the INSERT, `transition`'s UPDATE and
/// `adjust_effective_to`'s. The constraint ranges over `effective_from`,
/// `effective_to` and `state`, so an UPDATE that moves an end re-offers the row's
/// interval to the exclusion index exactly as an INSERT offers a new one. Extending
/// an end is in fact the *stronger* claim of the two: it takes ground the row did
/// not previously hold.
///
/// So the loser of this race got `RepoError::Db("adjust pricing_price_window …")`
/// — 500, "an internal error occurred, please retry later" — where the identical
/// collision one door over answered `WINDOW_OVERLAP`. Review F1, 2026-08-21.
///
/// # Why this reaches the constraint and not `refuse_overlap`
///
/// `adjust_effective_to` is **not** unguarded: it walks the key with
/// `refuse_overlap` before it writes, and on an uncontended store that walk is what
/// answers. A case that simply extended a window into a committed neighbour would
/// therefore prove nothing about the mapping under test — it would be refused by
/// the read, one screen earlier, and stay green with the recognizer removed.
///
/// The interleaving is what puts the constraint in the answering seat, and every
/// step of it is load-bearing:
///
/// * the neighbour `[2099-04, 2099-06)` is written by T1 and **left uncommitted**,
///   so under `READ COMMITTED` T2's `refuse_overlap` cannot see it and passes for
///   real rather than being bypassed;
/// * T2's own interval `[2099-01, 2099-03)` does not touch it either, so nothing
///   in T2's pre-check has anything to say;
/// * T2's UPDATE then extends the end to `2099-05`, which does. Postgres parks T2
///   on T1's transaction id rather than refusing it outright — the same wait
///   [`a_second_overlapping_window_on_one_key_is_refused_by_the_store`]'s doc
///   records as a harness deadlock if the release is downstream of the verdict —
///   so `pg_support::wait_until_a_backend_blocks` drives the release and doubles as
///   the assertion that the two writers met at all.
///
/// # The assertion is the error the caller gets, not a row count
///
/// An `EXCLUDE` violation is SQLSTATE `23P01` and `is_unique_violation` matches
/// `23505` alone, so the untyped answer is `RepoError::Db` and the door renders it
/// `DomainError::Internal`. A case that counted surviving rows would be green about
/// that 500. The key and the rendered interval are asserted with the variant,
/// because they are what makes the refusal actionable: `WINDOW_OVERLAP` with an
/// empty key names no conflict an operator can go and resolve.
