//! Draft price rows and their tier bands against a real database.
//!
//! Almost nothing here is a property of a branch in Rust. The compare-and-swap
//! is a conjunction the database evaluates under the row lock; the band set's
//! order is an `ORDER BY` and not an in-memory sort of what the caller happened
//! to hand over; the foreign key decides in which order two DELETEs may run; and
//! the scope-key check has to see rows this process never wrote. A mock would
//! assert that the repository's own `if` fires and would keep asserting it after
//! the predicate that matters had been deleted.
//!
//! Four things get more room than their line count suggests.
//!
//! The **rollback** is driven by a `flat` row carrying bands, which is the only
//! shape that fails *between* the two writes: the row lands, and the band
//! table's kind trigger refuses the statement after it. Every other refusal in
//! this file happens before the first write or after the last, so the whole
//! suite passed with `in_transaction` replaced by sequential statements on a
//! plain connection — the repository's headline claim, "both tables or
//! neither", asserted by nothing.
//!
//! The **band order** is pinned from rows the database physically holds the
//! wrong way round, not from an out-of-order authoring: `create_draft`
//! normalizes before it writes, so a case driven through it would certify an
//! in-memory sort and leave the read side unpinned. `update_draft` does not
//! normalize, so it is what puts descending rows in the table, and the suite
//! reads the table with no `ORDER BY` to prove they are really there.
//!
//! The **occupied-key** cases are driven for a draft, a published and a
//! superseded occupant, because the repository's check answers all three while
//! the two partial `UNIQUE` indexes answer none of them the same way — and the
//! draft index gets a case of its own, driven through the entity rather than the
//! repository, because it is the half that decides a race the check can only
//! read for.
//!
//! The **content write** is exercised by an update that moves every column at
//! once and clears four of them. An update that submitted content identical to
//! what is stored except for the field under test would pass with any other
//! column silently dropped from the UPDATE.
