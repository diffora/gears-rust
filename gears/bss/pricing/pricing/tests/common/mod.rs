//! The database-under-test, the three verbs the schema suites drive it with, and
//! the one window every publishable fixture owes its rows.
//!
//! Everything here is shared because it has **no per-suite content at all**: a
//! migrated `SQLite` database, a statement that must land, a statement whose
//! result is read back, and the coverage window `inst-wc-required` demands of
//! any fixture that publishes. Each of the schema suites once carried its own
//! copy of the first three, and the copies had already stopped agreeing — not
//! about what the helpers do, but about the schema they were describing, so one
//! file said `pricing_price` carried nine `CHECK` constraints while the migration
//! that had grown six more sat two tasks away in the same branch. A helper each
//! suite re-types is a sentence each suite has to keep true on its own.
//!
//! [`schedule_coverage_window`] is here for the sharper version of that reason.
//! Four seeds across four suites publish a plan, and each of them now owes its
//! rows a window. Four copies of that decision would be four places to change the
//! day the rule moves, and four chances for one of them to schedule a window that
//! satisfies the letter of the rule while asserting about a world the system
//! would not hold.
//!
//! What is deliberately **not** here is `must_be_rejected`. Every suite asserts
//! that a refusal is *the one under test* — a raw "some error happened" would
//! pass with the guard it means to prove switched off — and the fragment that
//! makes that assertion sharp is different in each: the table name for the two
//! trigger suites, the constraint name for the CHECK suite. Hoisting them into
//! one helper would mean taking the weakest of the three, which is how a suite
//! ends up green against a schema that no longer holds.
//!
//! The chain is applied **sorted by migration name**, which is the order the
//! `Migrator` itself defines and which `tests/module_test.rs` pins: a table's
//! foreign key and every trigger that reads a parent depend on that parent
//! existing, so a suite that applied the chain in declaration order would fail
//! for a reason having nothing to do with what it is testing.
