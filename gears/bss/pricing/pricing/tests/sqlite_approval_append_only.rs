//! `pricing_approval`'s and `pricing_approval_key`'s append-only triggers on the
//! executed `SQLite` mirror.
//!
//! Postgres carries the rule as one PL/pgSQL function with five branches;
//! `SQLite` has no procedural language, so the migration mirrors it as five
//! `RAISE(ABORT, ...)` triggers with literal messages. Until this file existed
//! **all of them could be deleted with the whole crate green** — nothing
//! asserted their presence and nothing executed them — while
//! `tests/sqlite_approval_repo.rs` opened its module doc by claiming that "the
//! refusals are the ones the trigger and the CHECKs produce". The CHECK half was
//! true; the trigger half was not. `tests/sqlite_append_only.rs` is the
//! precedent: `pricing_price`'s mirror triggers are executed there for the same
//! reason, and the mirror is the backend e2e and dev boot on.
//!
//! One test per trigger, each written so that trigger is the **only** object
//! that can answer:
//!
//! | trigger | test |
//! |---|---|
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_born_submitted` | `a_record_is_born_submitted_or_it_is_not_born` |
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_no_delete` | `an_approval_row_cannot_be_deleted` |
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_immutable_once_decided` | `a_decided_record_is_frozen` |
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_pinned_columns` | `a_decision_may_not_re_pin_what_it_decides` |
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_flip_whitelist` | `a_pending_record_cannot_stay_pending` |
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_key_no_delete` | `a_register_row_cannot_be_deleted` |
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_key_born_submitted` | `a_register_row_is_born_submitted` |
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_key_born_under_a_pending_unit` | `a_register_row_is_born_under_a_pending_unit` |
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_key_pinned_columns` | `a_register_row_cannot_be_re_pointed` |
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_key_follows_its_unit` | `an_ad_hoc_update_cannot_free_a_held_key` |
//! | `trg_pricing_approval_key_follow_state` | `a_decided_unit_frees_every_key_it_held` (`sqlite_window_service.rs`) |
//!
//! **The register's half was untested and its own doc claimed otherwise.** The
//! migration said the guards were "the same whitelist shape the parent carries, so an
//! ad-hoc `UPDATE` cannot free a key either", and that was false: the parent whitelists
//! the *destination* of a flip, the register only pinned its other columns — so
//! `UPDATE pricing_approval_key SET state = 'voided' WHERE scope_key = '<key>'` landed,
//! the parent stayed `submitted`, and `uq_pricing_approval_key_pending` then admitted a
//! second holder. [`an_ad_hoc_update_cannot_free_a_held_key`] is that statement,
//! executed. `trg_pricing_approval_key_follows_once` has no case of its own here for
//! the reason the pinned-columns note below gives — it and the direction whitelist
//! answer the same `UPDATE`, and `SQLite` fixes no order between two triggers on one
//! verb, so the case that separates them is the one where only one *can* fire.
//!
//! The pinned-columns case in particular moves a pinned column **as part of a
//! sanctioned flip**. Moving one on its own would leave `NEW.state` still
//! `submitted`, which trips the flip whitelist as well — and `SQLite` fixes no
//! order between two triggers on one verb, so that test would have been a coin
//! toss between two objects rather than evidence about either.

/// A register row cannot be re-pointed at another unit, tenant or key.
///
/// The row **is** the record of what the unit held, so every column but `state` is
/// pinned. Each statement here also sets `state` to the value its unit is already in,
/// which is what keeps the two neighbouring guards out of the answer: a statement that
/// moved `state` would be refused by the direction whitelist or by the follows-once
/// arm, and `SQLite` fixes no order between two triggers on one verb.
///
/// **The `approval_id` case needs a second *existing, pending* unit to point at, and
/// that is not staging convenience.** Pointing it at an id nobody holds is refused by
/// the direction whitelist instead — the subquery finds no unit, so `NEW.state` matches
/// nothing — which was measured: the case passed for the wrong guard's reason until the
/// second unit was seeded. With a real pending unit at the other end, the whitelist is
/// satisfied and the pinned-columns guard is the only object that can refuse.
