//! `BundleService::publish_composition` — D-07's normalisation, as a **write**
//! (`design/08-bundles.md` §2, `inst-rs-residual`, `inst-ba-return`).
//!
//! Where `tests/sqlite_bundle_repo.rs` drives the composition's authoring and
//! `src/domain/bundle_tests.rs` drives the reconciler's arithmetic, this suite
//! drives the one thing neither can: the statement that puts the reconciled
//! shares in the store, and what happens when it addresses nothing.
//!
//! **Nothing exercised that statement before this file.** `rest_bundles`' publish
//! case runs an `own_price` bundle, which carries no rev-share group at all, so
//! `write_effective_share` had no caller under any green tree — the column
//! downstream vendors are paid on was written by code no test ever ran.

/// **This is an approval bypass, not a lost update, and that is why it is here.**
///
/// `api::rest::bundles` computes `bundle_content_hash(shape, draft.row_version)`,
/// matches an approved unit on that digest, and only then calls
/// `publish_composition` — which used to re-read the composition on a **third**
/// connection, outside its own writing transaction. So an ordinary authorised
/// `PATCH …/bundles/{id}` landing between the match and the read left the act
/// reconciling and paying out a composition no second principal had seen, while
/// `BundleUpdated` announced it. The column being written is what downstream
/// vendor parties are paid on.
///
/// The version the pin was taken over is now handed down and compared inside the
/// writing transaction, so the moved composition is `StaleRowVersion` — the
/// contention refusal the act previously reported as `CorruptRow` when the
/// divergence happened to strand a party row (Z9-6) and reported not at all when
/// it did not.
///
/// **The edit here changes the split and not only the version**, so a fix that
/// compared versions but still wrote from the stale read would be caught by the
/// share assertion as well as by the refusal.
