//! `BundleRepo` — creating a bundle on a plan, and replacing an open draft
//! revision's whole composition under that revision's entity tag.
//!
//! Where `tests/sqlite_bundle_store.rs` drives raw SQL past every repository to
//! prove the **schema**, this suite drives the repository, because what it proves
//! is the repository's: which refusal a caller is told, what the store holds
//! afterwards, and that the compare-and-swap is in SQL rather than in a read.
//!
//! **The composition carries no entity tag of its own.** It rides the plan
//! revision's, exactly as `PlanShapeRepo`'s child sets do and for that module's
//! reason: if editing the component set left the revision's tag alone, two
//! authors editing one draft would both satisfy `If-Match` and silently
//! interleave — the lost update `fr-concurrent-edit` exists to refuse.
