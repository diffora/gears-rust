//! Two sweeps over one due window, on real Postgres: one flip, one event.
//!
//! # Why this cannot be a `SQLite` suite, and why it cannot be two `run` calls
//!
//! `sqlite::memory:` **serializes writers**, so the interleaving under test can
//! be neither confirmed nor refuted there.
//! `tests/sqlite_window_activation.rs` proves that a *second* pass over the same
//! instant finds nothing due — which is the sequential half, and it is a
//! statement about the due read. What it cannot show is what happens when two
//! passes are **in flight at once**, both having read the same `scheduled` row
//! before either wrote: the case a multi-replica deployment produces every time
//! the coordination lease is lost or taken over, and the only case in which the
//! outbox dedup key is doing anything at all.
//!
//! Calling `run` twice would prove nothing about it. The second call's read
//! happens after the first call's commit, so it is the sequential test again with
//! extra steps.
//!
//! # The choreography, and why each step is there
//!
//! The idiom of `tests/postgres_approval_race.rs` and
//! `tests/postgres_audit_chain.rs`, driven by observable events only:
//!
//! 1. a hand-rolled transaction performs exactly what one sweep's flip does —
//!    the `transition` and the `enqueue` — and then **parks**, holding the
//!    window row's lock and the aggregate's `seq` uncommitted;
//! 2. a real [`WindowActivationJob::run`] starts. Its due read sees the still
//!    committed `scheduled` row, and its `UPDATE` blocks on that lock;
//! 3. a third connection **observes the block** in `pg_locks`, narrowed to
//!    `current_database()` because one server carries every test's database at
//!    once — which is what proves the sweep's read already happened;
//! 4. only then is the parked transaction released to commit, and the sweep's
//!    `UPDATE` re-evaluates `state = 'scheduled' AND effective_from <= at` under
//!    READ COMMITTED, matches nothing, and resolves into a no-op flip whose
//!    event the dedup key refuses.
//!
//! Step 3 is the load-bearing one. Without it the sweep could read the *flipped*
//! row, find nothing due, and report zero — green, and about nothing.
//!
//! # What "one flip and one event" rests on, precisely
//!
//! Not the lease: the lease is what makes this rare, not what makes it safe, and
//! a lease can be lost. Two things carry it, and the suite asserts both:
//!
//! - the **transition predicate** in the `UPDATE`'s `WHERE`, which makes the
//!   loser's flip match zero rows rather than re-stamping `activated_at`;
//! - the **dedup key** `PriceWindowActivated/<window_id>`, which makes the loser's
//!   event the same event and is refused by *either* of the two constraints it
//!   reaches — `uq_pricing_outbox_dedup_key` or the `outbox_id` primary key derived
//!   from the same pair. The suite asserts one row, not which index said no; the
//!   driver's error class cannot tell them apart (`contention_or_db` says so).
//!
//! **What this suite does not prove**, said here rather than left to the reader:
//! that the flip and the enqueue sharing one transaction is what keeps them
//! together. In this race the loser has nothing to roll back on the window side —
//! its `UPDATE` matched zero rows and `transition` answers `Ok` on the self-edge —
//! so what is demonstrated is *one flip, one event*, and the transaction is doing no
//! work in the demonstration. The property the transaction carries is a **committed
//! flip whose enqueue then fails**, and reaching it needs an injected enqueue
//! failure this suite has no way to produce; it holds by the shape of the code, one
//! `in_transaction` closure containing both writes.
//!
//! Ignored by default; they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p bss-pricing --test postgres_window_activation -- --ignored`.
