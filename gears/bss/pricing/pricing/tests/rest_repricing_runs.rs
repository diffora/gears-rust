//! The mass-repricing run's two surfaces, over HTTP
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §5, `inst-mr-api`, `inst-mr-journal`,
//! `inst-mr-return`, `inst-mp-grandfathered`; D-88, D-134, D-261, D-307).
//!
//! Every case asserts what the **store** holds and not only what the response
//! said. A `202` carrying a journal assembled from the caller's own request would
//! be a receipt for a freeze that may not have happened — the defect D-225 records
//! for the overlay submit — so the frozen row set is read back through the `GET`,
//! which is also `inst-mr-return`'s progress endpoint and therefore the thing
//! under test rather than a convenience. The two edges out of `validating`
//! (`inst-mr-coalesce`) are asserted the same way: on the **stored** run and the
//! **stored** approval unit, never on the response body alone — a route that
//! answered a materiality literal it had never computed would still pass a test
//! that only read the response, which is exactly the defect a 2026-08-10 review
//! records for the bundle publish's own materiality assertion.
//!
//! **No apply runs on a request here**, because none does in production either:
//! both surfaces that accept a run enqueue its apply on
//! `infra::repricing::RunApplyLane`, and this harness runs no lifecycle. A case
//! whose subject is the apply therefore calls `Harness::drain_repricing_applies`
//! between the `POST` (or the approve) and its assertion, and asserts the drain's
//! **count** as well as the run's state: a run left at `committing` is what a
//! handler that enqueued nothing and a drain that applied nothing both leave
//! behind, so the state alone cannot tell those apart from a real apply.
//!
//! **No case in this file configures a threshold policy unless its own name says
//! so.** A fresh harness has none, so `inst-mat-failsafe` makes every ordinary run
//! here material and therefore `awaiting_approval` — which is what lets the cases
//! that predate the two edges keep asserting the row set and the audit record
//! without also standing up a policy fixture for a fact they are not about.
