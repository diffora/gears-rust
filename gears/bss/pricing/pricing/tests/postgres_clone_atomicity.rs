//! The clone is one act on Postgres too (D-272, D-275).
//!
//! **Why this exists as its own suite.** `tests/sqlite_clone.rs` proves the whole
//! copy set and proves the rollback, but it proves them on `SQLite`. What the
//! clone does between BEGIN and the caller's failure is **nine** write functions
//! issuing DELETEs and INSERTs across **eleven** tables — the plan, its four
//! child shape tables, the four bundle tables, the price row, and the D-135 audit
//! log every one of those writers appends to. Eight of the eleven carry
//! append-only triggers and `CHECK` constraints this gear spells **twice**, once
//! in PL/pgSQL and once as `RAISE(ABORT, …)`, and two spellings are only ever as
//! equal as the suites that hold them to it. (`pricing_bundle` itself carries
//! none — only its three children do — and `pricing_price_tier_band` is a twelfth
//! table, reached when a copied row has bands, which this seed's flat row does
//! not.)
//!
//! So the seed carries phases, an add-on rule, a descriptor set, a composite
//! meter, a bundle with two components and a rev-share group, and a published
//! price row: enough that **every** writer `clone_plan_on` can reach actually
//! runs here. It began as a plan and one price row, which reached three writers
//! of nine and skipped every guarded branch — a seed small enough to make the
//! suite agree with itself while testing almost none of what it claimed. The
//! assertions came second and were narrower than the seed for one round: the
//! add-on rule and the composition were authored and never read back, so two of
//! those writers could have been deleted with this suite still green.
//!
//! **What is under test is the rollback arm, not statement failure.** Both cases
//! run the clone to completion and then fail the *closure*; no SQL statement
//! fails, so the engines' famous difference — `SQLite` carrying on where Postgres
//! aborts the transaction — is not what is engaged. `Db::in_transaction`'s
//! `Err ⇒ rollback` is engine-independent. What is engine-specific is everything
//! the writers touched on the way there, which is the reason above.
//!
//! The failure is the **caller's**. Every failure the clone could raise from its
//! own data is unreachable: of the four scope-key axes the reset changes — plan,
//! phase, eligibility, cohort — the two that could collapse two source rows onto
//! one target key are operand-free by the time a row reaches the copy (D-266,
//! D-268), and the phase remap is injective. This is also the route's own shape,
//! where `idempotent::guarded` owns the transaction and its bookkeeping is what
//! fails after the clone.
