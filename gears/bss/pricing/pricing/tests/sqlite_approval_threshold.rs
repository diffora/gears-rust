//! `pricing_approval_threshold` on the `SQLite` mirror — the same five CHECKs and
//! the same two triggers, executed.
//!
//! The Postgres suite (`tests/postgres_approval_threshold.rs`) is the canonical
//! one; this exists because **a missing `SQLite` constraint has twice left the
//! whole suite green**. Almost every in-crate test reaches the mirror, so a guard
//! the mirror does not carry is a guard nothing exercises: the Rust layer refuses
//! the same values, and the schema's silence is invisible behind it.
//!
//! The mirror differs from the canonical schema in exactly one way that matters
//! here, and it is in this suite's favour: `SQLite` does not enforce `varchar(3)`,
//! so `chk_pricing_approval_threshold_currency` is observable on the **long** side
//! as well as the short one, where on Postgres the type answers first.
//!
//! The staging rules are the Postgres suite's — every row is valid but for the one
//! thing under test, because `..._basis` refuses most of what its siblings refuse.
