//! The FX rate-provider plugin contract (`RateProviderV1`).
//!
//! A cross-gear, GTS-versioned SDK trait (`gts.cf.bss.ledger.rate-provider.v1`,
//! mirroring [`crate::LedgerClientV1`]): an external adapter-gear (ECB primary /
//! PSP-bank fallback) implements it and registers an `Arc<dyn RateProviderV1>` in
//! the `ClientHub`; a ledger-side `RateSyncJob` pulls `fetch_latest` into the
//! local rate store. The adapter ONLY fetches — translation, triangulation, and
//! staleness all stay in the ledger. The default [`UnconfiguredRateProviderV1`]
//! is a fail-safe no-op (the store stays empty → FX-needing posts block).
