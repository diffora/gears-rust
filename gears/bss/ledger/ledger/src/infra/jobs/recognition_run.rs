//! `RecognitionRunJob` — the periodic ASC 606 S6 **release** ticker (Slice 4,
//! Group F2). Each tick it finds the tenants with due `PENDING`/`QUEUED`
//! recognition segments ACROSS ALL TENANTS and triggers one recognition run per
//! tenant **for the CURRENT period**, releasing that period's due segments
//! (the current period + any past-due catch-up; FUTURE segments wait until their
//! period is current — never recognized early, H1/Z6-1) through the
//! [`RecognitionRunService`] (the same orchestration the `POST
//! /recognition-runs` REST endpoint drives).
//!
//! The REST endpoint is the on-demand trigger; this job is the automatic
//! backstop so a due period's segments release promptly once the period opens
//! even with no operator call — exactly as the `QueueApplierJob` backstops the
//! drain-on-settle hook. Both are idempotent: a run releases each segment
//! at-most-once via the per-segment `RECOGNITION` idempotency gate (a re-run
//! re-credits nothing), so a redundant tick is harmless.
//!
//! ## System-context / cross-tenant (mirrors `QueueApplierJob` / `period_open`)
//! Finding due work is an UNSCOPED, cross-tenant read
//! ([`RecognitionRepo::list_due_tenant_periods`] under
//! [`AccessScope::allow_all`], the sanctioned system-context pattern). Each run
//! is then SCOPED per-tenant by [`AccessScope::for_tenant`] when the
//! [`RecognitionRunService`] posts — the cross-tenant list is only a candidate
//! feed. A per-`(tenant, period)` run error is isolated (logged, the pass
//! continues) so one flaky tenant doesn't starve the rest, exactly like the
//! peer jobs. The run actor is the system-context [`SecurityContext::anonymous`]
//! (the same anonymous actor the queue-applier sweep posts under — this is not a
//! per-request caller).
