//! `AgedAlarmJob` — periodic `Warn`-severity alarms for work that has aged past
//! a threshold without clearing (architecture §6). Three families:
//!
//! - **`AGED_ALLOCATION_QUEUE`** — a `PAYMENT_ALLOCATE` queue row still `QUEUED`
//!   whose `queued_at` is older than [`AGED_THRESHOLD_SECS`] (its settlement never
//!   landed, or the drain keeps failing).
//! - **`DISPUTE_PHASE_QUEUED`** — the same for a `CHARGEBACK` queue row (an
//!   out-of-order `won`/`lost` awaiting its `opened`).
//! - **`AGED_UNALLOCATED`** — an `unallocated_balance` grain still holding cash
//!   (`balance_minor > 0`) whose OLDEST contributing `UNALLOCATED` journal line
//!   posted longer ago than the threshold (unapplied receipts nobody allocated).
//!
//! Unlike the hard `TieOutJob` invariants (which are `Critical`), aged alarms are
//! `Warn`: they flag *latency*, not a books defect — the queue/cache is correct,
//! just stale. They are re-emitted every tick until the aged item clears, exactly
//! like a re-detected tie-out variance.
//!
//! ## Age proxy for `AGED_UNALLOCATED` (resolves G-P5a — DECIDED)
//! `unallocated_balance` carries no age timestamp; `last_entry_seq` points at the
//! LATEST contributing entry (wrong direction). The age proxy is therefore the
//! **oldest** contributing `UNALLOCATED` line's post time: the gear has no
//! `posted_at_utc` on `journal_line` (it lives on `journal_entry`), so the job
//! reads both, builds an `entry_id -> posted_at_utc` map, groups the tenant's
//! `UNALLOCATED` lines by the unallocated grain `(payer, account, currency)`
//! (mirroring `BalanceProjector::derive_grains`), and takes the MIN post time per
//! grain. A grain is flagged iff that min age exceeds the threshold AND the cache
//! `balance_minor > 0` (cash still parked). No migration.
//!
//! ## System-context / cross-tenant (mirrors `TieOutJob` + `QueueApplierJob`)
//! The aged-queue scan reads the UNSCOPED cross-tenant candidate feed
//! ([`PendingQueueRepo::list_all_due`]); the unallocated scan enumerates tenants
//! from `unallocated_balance` under [`AccessScope::allow_all`] and re-reads each
//! tenant's lines + cache under [`AccessScope::for_tenant`]. All aggregation is in
//! memory (the gear has no DB-side aggregate access — see the `TieOutJob` docs).
//! A per-tenant read failure is isolated (logged, the pass continues) so one
//! flaky tenant doesn't abort the tick. Age is measured against
//! [`chrono::Utc::now`] — this is a live periodic tick, not a deterministic
//! replay, so wall-clock `now` is the correct reference here.
