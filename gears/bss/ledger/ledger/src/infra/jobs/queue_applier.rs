//! `QueueApplierJob` — the periodic sweep that drains queued payment
//! allocations AND out-of-order chargeback phases (Slice 2b, Groups B–D).
//!
//! The drain-on-settle hook ([`crate::infra::payment::settle::SettlementService`])
//! applies a tenant's allocation queue right after a settle commits, but a queued
//! allocation whose settlement arrived through some OTHER path (or whose
//! drain-on-settle swallowed an error) still needs a backstop. This job is that
//! backstop: each tick it finds due `QUEUED` rows ACROSS ALL TENANTS for both the
//! `PAYMENT_ALLOCATE` flow (allocation-before-settlement) and the `CHARGEBACK`
//! flow (an out-of-order `won`/`lost` whose `opened` has since landed), then
//! drains each tenant under its own scope. A fresh `opened` also drains the
//! CHARGEBACK flow inline (`ChargebackService::record_phase`, mirroring
//! drain-on-settle); this periodic sweep is the backstop.
//!
//! ## System-context / cross-tenant (mirrors `period_open`)
//! Finding due rows is an UNSCOPED, cross-tenant read
//! ([`PendingQueueRepo::list_all_due`], the sanctioned system-context pattern of
//! [`crate::infra::storage::repo::ReferenceRepo::list_all_fiscal_calendars`]).
//! Each APPLY is then scoped per-tenant by `AccessScope::for_tenant(tenant)` via
//! the [`QueueApplier`] (which claims under `SKIP LOCKED` in its own txn, so the
//! cross-tenant list is only a candidate feed — a row another applier grabbed
//! first is simply skipped). The gauge read is likewise unscoped
//! ([`PendingQueueRepo::count_all_by_status`]).
