//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.audit_pack_export` — one materialized audit-pack
//! export job (Slice 6 §5/§10). `POST …/audit/packs` creates a row and returns
//! `202 Accepted` + a `Location` to `GET …/audit/packs/{exportId}`, which polls
//! this row for the job `status` and, once `succeeded`, the materialized CSV.
//!
//! The row is owned by the **requester's home tenant** (`tenant_id`) — the same
//! tenant the cross-tenant-access forensic record is written under — so the
//! requester polls it under its own scope. `target_tenant_id` records whose
//! ledger was opened (equal to `tenant_id` on a routine same-tenant export).
//!
//! **MVP is contract-only (§10 interim).** The CSV is still built synchronously
//! in the create request, so a created row is born `succeeded` with its `csv`
//! set. The wire contract (202 + `Location` + polling) is the durable part; a
//! background worker that flips `accepted` → `processing` → `succeeded` is a
//! future extension that needs no migration (the `status` values already model
//! it).
//!
//! `SQLite` (the non-production test backend) mirrors the shape with the
//! systematic transforms (drop the `bss.` prefix; `uuid` → `text`;
//! `bytea` → `blob`; `timestamptz` → `text`).
