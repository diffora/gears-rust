//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.ledger_credit_note` (the record linking a posted
//! credit note to its originating posted invoice item, revenue stream, and the
//! recognized/deferred split basis, keyed by `(tenant_id, credit_note_id)`).
//! Tenant-scoped via `SecureORM`; the resource col is the business
//! `credit_note_id` (mirrors `recognition_schedule`'s `schedule_id`).
//!
//! `amount_minor` is incl-tax; `recognized_part_minor` + `deferred_part_minor`
//! are the ex-tax split parts recorded by the `RecognizedDeferredSplitter`
//! (Phase 1, Group B) — they do NOT sum to `amount_minor`, so there is
//! deliberately no `recognized + deferred == amount` CHECK. The headroom cap
//! lives on `invoice_exposure`; the deferred-portion schedule reduction
//! (`recognized_minor <= total_deferred_minor`) is guarded on
//! `recognition_schedule` (Slice 4), both written under the lock order.
