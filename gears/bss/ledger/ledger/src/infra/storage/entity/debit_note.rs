//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.ledger_debit_note` (the record linking a posted debit
//! note — an additional charge — to its originating posted invoice and its
//! recognized/deferred split, keyed by `(tenant_id, debit_note_id)`).
//! Tenant-scoped via `SecureORM`; the resource col is the business
//! `debit_note_id` (mirrors `recognition_schedule`'s `schedule_id`).
//!
//! `amount_minor` is incl-tax; `recognized_part_minor` + `deferred_part_minor`
//! are the ex-tax split parts — as with `credit_note`, they do NOT sum to
//! `amount_minor`, so there is deliberately no `recognized + deferred == amount`
//! CHECK. A debit note raises the invoice's headroom
//! (`invoice_exposure.debit_note_total_minor += amount`) under the lock order.
