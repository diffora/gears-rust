//! `SeaORM` entity for `bss.ledger_verified_balance` — the cumulative VERIFIED
//! tie-out baseline per grain through the last closed period (VHP-1843
//! incremental tie-out). One row per `(tenant_id, grain, grain_key)`; the daily
//! job and the `AR_DERIVED` recon check verify `baseline + fold(open periods) ==
//! cache` instead of folding all-time. Written in the period-close txn right
//! after the clean full tie-out passes. Tenant-scoped via `SecureORM`.
