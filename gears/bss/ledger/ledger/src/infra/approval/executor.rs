//! `LedgerApprovalExecutor` — the concrete [`ApprovalExecutor`] that replays an
//! approved [`ApprovalIntent`] against the real mutation surfaces (VHP-1852,
//! Group E). Reverse goes through the posting engine (read-back the original →
//! `build_reversal` → `post_reversal`); credit-grant and chargeback-loss go
//! through the `LedgerClientV1` surfaces (which re-apply their own PEP gate +
//! idempotency). Replay is idempotent: a re-approve short-circuits on the
//! foundation idempotency key, so execute-then-mark is safe.
