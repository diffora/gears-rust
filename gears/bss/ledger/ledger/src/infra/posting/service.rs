//! Transactional decimal posting engine. Each serializable attempt validates
//! structure, clock, tenant lock and accounts, then claims dedup, validates fresh
//! currency metadata, checks freeze/period/policy, inserts and projects, runs the
//! sidecar, seals the chain, finalizes dedup and calls the parked publisher.
//! All database-dependent reads use the supplied transaction. External alarms
//! are emitted by the retry-owning wrapper, outside the transaction body.
//!
//! ## Error handling across the transaction boundary
//!
//! Legacy in-transaction helpers use [`DbError`], yet a business rejection
//! discovered AFTER a write (e.g. a
//! negative balance after the journal insert) MUST roll the transaction
//! back. Those helpers encode a business [`DomainError`] into a
//! sentinel [`DbError::Sea`] (`DbErr::Custom`) and returns `Err`, forcing a
//! rollback. The typed retry boundary decodes sentinels before classifying
//! real driver contention. Explicit concurrency conflicts and driver contention
//! consume one shared budget of three whole-transaction attempts.
