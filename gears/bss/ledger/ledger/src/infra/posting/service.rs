//! `PostingService` — the transactional posting engine. One ACID
//! transaction per entry runs the full sequence: idempotency claim → insert
//! balanced lines → fiscal-period gate → account lifecycle + `normal_side`
//! lookup → balance projection → finalize → COMMIT. Pure structural
//! invariants (`validate_balanced_entry`) and the line-count ceiling are
//! checked BEFORE the transaction opens, so a malformed request never takes
//! a write lock.
//!
//! ## Error handling across the transaction boundary
//!
//! [`DBProvider::transaction`] fixes the closure error type to
//! [`DbError`], yet a business rejection discovered AFTER a write (e.g. a
//! negative balance after the journal insert) MUST roll the transaction
//! back. The closure therefore encodes a business [`DomainError`] into a
//! sentinel [`DbError::Sea`] (`DbErr::Custom`) and returns `Err`, forcing a
//! rollback; once `transaction()` returns, the sentinel is decoded back into
//! the original [`DomainError`]. A `DbError` WITHOUT the sentinel prefix is a
//! genuine infrastructure fault and surfaces as [`DomainError::Internal`].
