//! [`ScheduleBuilderSidecar`] — the in-transaction [`PostSidecar`] that
//! materializes ASC 606 recognition schedules in the SAME serializable
//! transaction as the invoice post's `CR CONTRACT_LIABILITY` credit (design
//! §4.2 / Group C2/C3). Mirrors the payment
//! [sidecars](crate::infra::payment::sidecar): its writes commit atomically with
//! the journal entry or roll back with it (a derivation that produced a schedule
//! whose insert fails — or a duplicate-build collision — rolls the whole post
//! back, so a deferred Contract-liability balance never exists without its
//! schedule, and a schedule never exists without the balance).
//!
//! For each [`BuiltSchedule`] the pure derivation produced (one per deferred
//! item-stream), [`run`](ScheduleBuilderSidecar::run):
//!
//! 1. **Claims `SCHEDULE_BUILD` idempotency** keyed
//!    `business_id = source_invoice_id:source_invoice_item_ref:revenue_stream`.
//!    `SCHEDULE_BUILD` posts NO journal entry of its own (the invoice post is the
//!    entry); the claim is purely the at-most-once build guard. On a **replay**
//!    (the key is already present — a duplicate build of the same invoice/item/
//!    stream) it **skips** the schedule (the ACTIVE schedule already exists; the
//!    partial UNIQUE is the storage backstop) and does NOT mint a second
//!    `schedule_id`. The claim is never `finalize`d (there is no result entry to
//!    stamp); it stays `CLAIMED` as a permanent build marker.
//! 2. On a **fresh claim**, mints a fresh `schedule_id` (`UUIDv7` string), projects
//!    the [`BuiltSchedule`] into the [`NewSchedule`] + [`NewSegment`] insert
//!    shapes (supplying the posting-context identity it holds — `tenant_id`,
//!    `payer_tenant_id`, `source_invoice_id`, and the schedule's
//!    `source_invoice_item_ref`), and inserts both via [`RecognitionRepo`].
//!
//! A deferred item MUST carry an `invoice_item_ref` (`source_invoice_item_ref`
//! is `NOT NULL` and must resolve to the Contract-liability line this very post
//! created, §4.7) — the orchestrator blocks a deferred item that lacks one
//! BEFORE the post, so every [`PlannedScheduleMaterialization`] here already
//! carries a non-empty ref.

///
/// **The reversed segment stays `DONE` (design §4.3).** A reversal compensates a
/// release that genuinely happened; the segment's release is a historical fact,
/// so its `recognition_segment` row is left untouched (`status = DONE`,
/// `recognized_at`/`run_id` preserved). Re-recognizing the period needs a NEW
/// schedule version (a fresh `schedule_id`, Phase 3) — never a re-flip of this
/// segment back to `PENDING`. This sidecar therefore writes ONLY the counter
/// decrement; it does not touch the segment row.
///
/// **Lock order (design §2 / §4.3).** Same as the release: the post's projection
/// already locked the `REVENUE` + `CONTRACT_LIABILITY` `account_balance` rows
/// (rank 0); this sidecar then takes only the `recognition_schedule` row (the
/// `recognized_minor` delta, rank 6). It never touches `recognition_segment`
/// (rank 7), so it acquires a strict prefix of the release's lock set — no new
/// ordering edge, no deadlock.
///
/// **Underflow guard.** `add_recognized` with a negative delta is guarded by the
/// per-schedule `recognized_minor >= 0` cap CHECK
/// (`chk_ledger_recognition_schedule_recognized_nonneg`): a reversal larger than
/// the cumulative recognized would drive the counter below zero and is rejected,
/// surfacing from the repo as [`RepoError::MoneyOutCapExceeded`] (both schedule
/// CHECKs share the `chk_ledger_recognition_schedule_` prefix the repo's
/// violation classifier keys on). This sidecar refines that to
/// [`DomainError::OverRecognition`] with a reversal-specific detail — a reversal
