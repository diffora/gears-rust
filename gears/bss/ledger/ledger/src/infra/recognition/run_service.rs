//! `RecognitionRunService` — the Group E orchestration wrapper around a
//! [`RecognitionRunner`] pass (design §4.3 / §5, the S6 release). It brackets
//! one `run_period` pass with the `recognition_run` row lifecycle (dedup →
//! `RUNNING` → `DONE`/`FAILED`) and maps the [`RunPeriodSummary`] onto the SDK
//! [`RecognitionRunOutcome`] (`Ran` vs `Queued`).
//!
//! **Idempotent replay (dedup).** A trigger whose `(tenant, period_id, run_id)`
//! already has a `recognition_run` row replays that run reference
//! (`Ran { replayed: true }`) instead of starting a second run — the run-trigger
//! idempotency key (design §4.3). The key includes `period_id`, so reusing one
//! `run_id` across two periods runs both. A `None` `run_id` mints a fresh one
//! (`Uuid::now_v7`), so an un-keyed trigger always runs.
//!
//! **Single-active-run guard (`coord` lease).** A fresh trigger acquires a
//! [`coord`] lease keyed `recognition-run:{tenant}:{period_id}` (a TTL + renewal
//! heartbeat) before it runs. A concurrent trigger for the same
//! `(tenant, period_id)` sees [`CoordError::LeaseHeld`] and returns a no-op
//! replay (`Ran { replayed: true, released: 0 }`) instead of racing the holder.
//! This serialises redundant runs and removes the `SERIALIZABLE` contention two
//! overlapping passes would otherwise hit on the shared per-segment
//! `RECOGNITION` idempotency claim. Correctness never depended on it — each
//! segment release is already at-most-once via that claim + the `status = DONE`
//! guard — so a lease that lapses mid-pass (a pathologically long run) cannot
//! double-credit; it only re-admits a redundant pass. The heartbeat keeps the
//! lease live across a normal pass; a crashed run's lease lapses at TTL so the
//! period is re-runnable within ~a minute.
//!
//! **Run-row bracketing.** Under the held lease a fresh trigger inserts the row
//! `RUNNING`, runs the pass, then flips it `DONE` (success) or `FAILED` (a
//! release error is propagated after the `FAILED` flip — the segments already
//! released stay committed, each being its own atomic post).
