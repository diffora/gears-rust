//! `RecognitionRunner` — the ASC 606 S6 **release** mechanism (design §4.3,
//! Group D1). It turns a due `PENDING` recognition segment into recognized
//! revenue by posting **one balanced entry** through the Slice 1
//! [`PostingService`]:
//!
//! | Line | Side | Account class |
//! |------|------|---------------|
//! | Recognize | DR | `CONTRACT_LIABILITY` (the segment's stream) |
//! | Revenue   | CR | `REVENUE` (the **same** stream) |
//!
//! `amount_minor` is the segment's amount, `currency` the schedule's currency,
//! and both legs carry the schedule's `revenue_stream` (per-stream disaggregation,
//! §4.5 — DR and CR draw the same stream). Each line's chart `account_id` is bound
//! from the provisioned chart of accounts via [`load_chart`] + [`ChartIndex::resolve`]
//! (mirroring [the invoice-post bind path](crate::infra::invoice_post)); the
//! per-line scale is resolved from the currency registry, exactly as the
//! settlement / invoice posts.
//!
//! **Atomicity + at-most-once.** The post threads a
//! [`RecognitionStampSidecar`](crate::infra::recognition::sidecar::RecognitionStampSidecar)
//! so the journal entry, the `recognized_minor += amount` counter bump (under the
//! per-schedule over-recognition cap CHECK → [`DomainError::OverRecognition`] 409),
//! and the segment `→ DONE` stamp all commit in the SAME serializable transaction
//! or roll back together (§4.3). The entry's `source_doc_type = RECOGNITION` +
//! `source_business_id = "{schedule_id}:{segment_no}"` key the Slice 1
//! `IdempotencyGate`, so the release is at-most-once per
//! `(tenant, RECOGNITION, schedule_id:segment_no)` — a replay returns the prior
//! [`PostingRef`] without re-crediting (and the sidecar never runs on a replay).
//!
//! **Scope.** [`Self::run_period`] releases the due `PENDING` segments for a
//! `(tenant, period_id)` in ascending `(schedule_id, segment_no)` order, applying
//! the E1 out-of-order → `QUEUED` guard, the E3 missed-close reassignment, and
//! the E4 obligation gate. The single-active-run orchestration + `recognition_run`
//! row live in the [`RecognitionRunService`](super::run_service). Group F adds:
//! [`Self::release_reversal`] (the `DR Revenue / CR CL` clawback keyed
//! `schedule_id:segment_no:reversal`, decrementing `recognized_minor`); the §9
//! recognition metrics (recognized-minor on release, queue-depth on a park); and
//! the EXPLICIT `RECOGNITION_PERIOD_QUEUED` (a park) + `RECOGNITION_DOUBLE_CREDIT`
//! (a detected re-credit) alarms — the `OVER_RECOGNITION` alarm is the posting
//! engine's (it fires on the rolled-back release). `effective_at` is the first
//! day of the segment's own `period_id` month (the natural-period convention);
//! the OPEN-period gate is the foundation's (the post fails `PeriodClosed` if the
//! segment's period is not open).
