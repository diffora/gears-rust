//! `SecuredAuditSink` — the Slice-3-local **port** for Slice 6's secured-audit
//! store (design §2.1, F1). Slice 6 (VHP-1858) owns the durable
//! `secured_audit_record` table + its append-only / hash-chained / retention
//! semantics, but its code is not in our base. So Slice 3 depends on this trait
//! whose method signature mirrors Slice 6's `SecuredAuditStore::append`
//! **exactly**:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! async fn append(
//!     &self,
//!     txn: &DbTx<'_>,
//!     scope: &AccessScope,
//!     tenant: Uuid,
//!     event_type: AuditEventType,
//!     actor_ref: Option<&str>,
//!     reason_code: Option<&str>,
//!     before_after: &serde_json::Value,
//!     correlation_id: Option<Uuid>,
//!     retain_until: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
//! ) -> Result<Uuid, DbError>;
//! ```
//!
//! [`NoopSecuredAuditSink`] is wired: it writes nothing durable, logging the
//! would-be record at `info` so the call is observable in traces. The
//! `before_after` payload is asserted PII-clean by the caller (ids + amounts +
//! enum codes only) before it reaches here (design §2.3).
//!
//! GAP (post-VHP-1858 rebase, tracked follow-up — NOT a runtime defect today):
//! Slice 6's real [`crate::infra::audit::store::SecuredAuditStore`] now lives in
//! the base, but the Slice-3 dispositions (the `unknown_final` refund clear in
//! `adjustment::refund_service` and the write-off capture in
//! `adjustment::manual_adjustment_service`) are STILL bound to the no-op sink —
//! the seam was NOT flipped during the rebase. A drop-in swap is not yet safe:
//! (a) the real `store::AuditEventType` taxonomy uses lowercase-hyphen tokens
//! (`"manual-adjustment"`, pinned by the `secured_audit_record` CHECK) whereas
//! this local mirror emits `SCREAMING_SNAKE` (`"MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT"`); (b) the
//! append signatures differ. Unifying onto the real store (or reconciling the
//! token + signature) is its own follow-up; until then nothing durable is
//! written for these two Slice-3 dispositions (the event/intent trail still
//! records them).
//!
//! [`AuditEventType`] is a LOCAL enum-mirror of Slice 6's audit-event taxonomy;
//! Slice 3 only needs the [`AuditEventType::ManualAdjustment`] variant (the same
//! variant Slice 6 stamps for a governed disposition / write-off — re-using it
//! avoids touching Slice 6's secured-audit migration enum at merge, design §2.1).
