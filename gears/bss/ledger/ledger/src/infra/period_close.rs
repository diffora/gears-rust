//! `PeriodCloseService` — the gated `OPEN→CLOSED` fiscal-period transition
//! (Slice 7 Group B). The close is **single-active** via a `coord` lease
//! (keyed `period-close:{tenant}:{legal_entity}:{period}`; a concurrent close
//! sees [`CoordError::LeaseHeld`] → [`DomainError::PeriodCloseInProgress`]), and
//! under the lease the read, the gate, and the flip run in ONE `SERIALIZABLE`
//! transaction with retry — so a post that lands an entry into the period
//! concurrently conflicts (Postgres SSI) and the close retries against the new
//! entry instead of certifying a period the entry slipped into.
//!
//! Close is **single-tenant**: everything runs under
//! `AccessScope::for_tenant(tenant_id)` plus a `(legal_entity, period)` filter
//! (NOT the cross-tenant system scope the daily jobs use).
//!
//! The **gate** blocks close while any of: the pre-close tie-out is not clean
//! (variance / imbalance / negative / PENDING mapping line); an OPEN
//! close-blocking `exception_queue` row exists for the period; a recognition
//! segment due `<=` the period is not `DONE`; or — Slice 7 Phase 3, behind their
//! enforcement flags — the period's **bill run is not asserted finished** or the
//! independent **issued-invoice manifest** shows issued invoices with no committed
//! posting (a configured-but-absent/failing feed fails loud) (design §4.5). A blocked close
//! records `period_close = CLOSING` + `blocked_reasons` (observability) and
//! returns [`DomainError::PeriodCloseBlocked`]; a clean close flips
//! `fiscal_period OPEN→CLOSED` and `period_close → CLOSED` in the same commit and
//! emits `billing.ledger.period.closed` in-txn (transactional outbox).
//!
//! **Realized as `coord` lease + SERIALIZABLE/SSI** rather than the design's
//! literal `fiscal_period FOR UPDATE` two-phase (recompute-outside-lock +
//! watermark): the toolkit's `SecureORM` does not expose row locks, and SSI is
//! correctness-equivalent for the close-vs-post race (the lease adds
//! single-active mutual exclusion). The recompute-outside-lock optimization is a
//! deferred follow-up (spec §3.1/§8). REOPEN + dual-control land in Group B-reopen.
