//! `ManualAdjustmentHandler` — the Slice-3 Phase-3 governed manual-adjustment
//! orchestrator (design §4.6, Group 4). It posts a governed manual adjustment's
//! balanced entry through the invariant [`PostingService`] after clearing the pure
//! [`govern`] gate, and publishes `billing.ledger.manual_adjustment.posted` in the
//! SAME post txn (via a [`PostSidecar`]). It is the ledger's governed escape hatch
//! for corrections the typed flows (invoice / settle / allocate / S3 notes / S4
//! recognition) do not cover — rounding residue, suspense / cash-clearing clean-up.
//!
//! **Flow.**
//! 1. **govern** ([`govern`], pure, out-of-txn): a [`ManualAdjustmentReject`]
//!    short-circuits the post. A generic [`ManualAdjustmentReject::NotAllowed`]
//!    becomes [`DomainError::ManualAdjustmentNotAllowed`] (a 400, no books effect);
//!    a [`ManualAdjustmentReject::AttemptedWriteOff`] additionally fires a
//!    [`SecuredAuditSink`] capture + the `AttemptedWriteOff` page out-of-band
//!    (Group 4 / §6 A4) before the same 400 — a disguised bad-debt is a
//!    deliberate-misuse signal, not a benign typo.
//! 2. **payer gate**: an `AR` / `UNALLOCATED` leg posts against a payer-scoped
//!    balance, so `payer_tenant_id` MUST be present (the projector grains AR /
//!    UNALLOCATED per payer); otherwise the adjustment is a payer-less internal
//!    move attributed to the tenant itself.
//! 3. **assemble + post**: resolve each leg's chart account + currency scale, build
//!    the balanced engine entry (`source_doc_type = MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT`,
//!    `source_business_id = adjustment_id`), and post it with the
//!    [`ManualAdjustmentPostSidecar`] (publishes the event in the post txn).
//!
//! **Idempotency** is the engine's `(tenant, MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT, adjustment_id)`
//! claim: the entry's `source_doc_type = ManualAdjustment` + `source_business_id =
//! adjustment_id` make [`PostingService::post`]'s `Fresh` claim the at-most-once
//! gate (a replay returns before the sidecar — byte-identical to the notes / refund
//! handlers).
//!
//! **Dual-control (Group 5 / Phase 3).** `SoD` (`preparer ≠ approver`) + the lifecycle
//! are the `ApprovalService`'s concern; this handler holds an OPTIONAL
//! [`ApprovalService`](crate::infra::approval::service::ApprovalService) seam
//! ([`ManualAdjustmentHandler::with_approval`]) and, when wired, gates a governed
//! manual adjustment whose gross (`Σ DR`) crosses the tenant's D2 threshold to the
//! preparer→approver queue ([`DomainError::DualControlRequired`]) BEFORE the post
//! (mirroring the refund gate). The approved replay re-enters through
//! [`ManualAdjustmentHandler::post_manual_adjustment_approved`] (gate-skipped,
//! executor-only). The un-gated handler (`None` approval) is the executor's replay
//! handler; the REST surface wires the gated one. There is also NO schedule /
//! headroom / record sidecar row
//! (unlike the credit-note sidecar): a governed manual adjustment touches no
//! `recognition_schedule` / `invoice_exposure` and writes no per-adjustment record
//! table in this MVP — its durable trail is the journal entry + the published event
//! (+ the secured-audit capture on the write-off path).
//!
//! Lives in `infra` (not `domain`): it needs repo + posting access; the
//! [`manual`](crate::domain::adjustment::manual) domain it calls stays pure (dylint
//! DE0301). Wraps the `pub` [`PostingService`] + repos directly (like
//! [`CreditNoteHandler`](super::credit_note_service::CreditNoteHandler)) so it is
//! constructible from out-of-crate integration tests.
