//! `RefundHandler` — the Slice-3 Phase-2 refund orchestrator (design §4.4, Groups
//! B + C). It posts a refund stage's balanced two-leg entry through the invariant
//! [`PostingService`] and, in the SAME serializable transaction (via a
//! [`PostSidecar`]), maintains the `payment_settlement` /
//! `payment_allocation_refund` money-out CAPS and persists the `refund` record
//! row:
//!
//! 1. **shape gate** ([`validate_shape`]): amounts + the Pattern-A/B `invoice_id`
//!    rule + the single-step/`confirmed` rule — a clean 400 before any read.
//! 2. **resolve the origin settlement** (out-of-txn, scoped): a refund unwinds a
//!    settled receipt, so the origin `payment_settlement` MUST exist for
//!    `(tenant, payment_id)` and its currency MUST match the refund's
//!    (`RefundOriginNotFound` / `CurrencyMismatch`). The settlement counters are
//!    the cap basis Group C guards; the lockless read is the pre-flight, the in-txn
//!    CHECKs are the authoritative backstop.
//! 3. **route by phase**:
//!    - `initiated` / `confirmed` → **forward post** ([`Self::post_forward`]):
//!      build the two-leg plan ([`build_refund_legs`]), post it with the
//!      [`RefundPostSidecar`] in [`CapMode::Initiate`] (stage-1, both patterns) /
//!      [`CapMode::None`] (stage-2 `confirmed` — the cash was already capped at
//!      stage-1; stage-2 only drains `REFUND_CLEARING`).
//!    - `rejected` / `voided` → **stage-1 reversal** ([`Self::post_reversal`],
//!      Group C): resolve the stage-1 `initiated` entry, post its STRICT
//!      line-negation (`reverses_entry_id = <stage-1 entry id>`; the legs are the
//!      stage-1 legs with sides inverted — `DR REFUND_CLEARING` against the
//!      restored `UNALLOCATED`(A) / `AR`(B)), and run the sidecar in
//!      [`CapMode::Release`] to DECREMENT the same counters stage-1 reserved + drain
//!      the `REFUND_CLEARING` balance to zero.
//!    - `unknown_final` → the terminal **dual-control disposition** (Group F,
//!      [`Self::post_unknown_final`]): PARKS the stuck `REFUND_CLEARING` on the
//!      SUSPENSE holding account (`DR REFUND_CLEARING · CR SUSPENSE` — not a
//!      premature loss/gain, the outcome is unknown) and writes a
//!      `secured_audit_record` (via the Slice-6 [`SecuredAuditSink`] port) in the
//!      same txn. Gated like a stage-1 cash commitment.
//!
//! **Caps (design §4.4 / §4.7, Group C).** A refund is money-OUT; the cap is
//! reserved at stage-1 initiation (before the cash leaves) and released on a
//! stage-1 reversal, ALL under the rank-1 `payment_settlement` lock with the
//! post-delta CHECKs as the authoritative over-refund backstop:
//! - **both patterns** bump `payment_settlement.refunded_minor` (total money-out:
//!   `refunded + clawed_back <= settled`);
//! - **Pattern A** additionally bumps `refunded_unallocated_minor` (spendable
//!   headroom: `allocated + refunded_unallocated <= settled` — refunded on-account
//!   cash can no longer be allocated);
//! - **Pattern B** additionally bumps `payment_allocation_refund.refunded_minor`
//!   per `(payment, invoice)` (`refunded <= allocated`).
//!
//! A cap-CHECK violation surfaces as [`RepoError::MoneyOutCapExceeded`], refined to
//! [`DomainError::RefundExceedsSettled`] (the settlement caps) /
//! [`DomainError::RefundExceedsAllocated`] (the per-invoice cap).
//!
//! **Idempotency** is the engine's `(tenant, REFUND, source_business_id)` claim
//! with `source_business_id = "{psp_refund_id}:{phase}"` (design §7: one PSP refund
//! advances through several phase rows — `initiated`, `confirmed`, OR
//! `rejected`/`voided` — each idempotent on `(psp_refund_id, phase)`). The `refund`
//! row's surrogate `(tenant, refund_id)` PK + the natural `UNIQUE (tenant,
//! psp_refund_id, phase)` index are the durable backstop.
//!
//! **Scope.** Groups B–F are in this handler: the two-leg posts + caps (B/C),
//! dual-control over the D2 threshold (D), refund-of-refund + the out-of-order /
//! underflow defer (E), and the `unknown_final` loss-clearing disposition +
//! secured-audit (F). REST (Group G) is the remaining surface.
//!
//! Lives in `infra` (not `domain`): it needs repo + posting access; the
//! [`refund`](crate::domain::adjustment::refund) domain it calls stays pure (dylint
//! DE0301). Wraps the `pub` [`PostingService`] + repos directly (like
//! [`CreditNoteHandler`](super::credit_note_service::CreditNoteHandler)) so it is
//! constructible from out-of-crate integration tests.
