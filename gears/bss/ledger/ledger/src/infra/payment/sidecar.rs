//! The payment post sidecars — in-transaction [`PostSidecar`] hooks the
//! settle / allocate orchestrators thread into the posting engine.
//!
//! [`SettlementSidecar`] seeds the `payment_settlement` counter row for a fresh
//! settlement. [`AllocationSidecar`] applies one allocation: it bumps
//! `allocated_minor` (the per-payment cap CHECK is the `SERIALIZABLE`
//! concurrency backstop — an over-cap surfaces as
//! [`DomainError::MoneyOutCapExceeded`]), inserts the N `payment_allocation`
//! rows, then bumps the per-`(payment, invoice)` allocation-refund counter.
//!
//! Both run inside the SAME serializable transaction as the journal post (see
//! the [`PostSidecar`] contract): their writes commit atomically with the entry
//! or roll back with it. This is INFRA code, so the wall clock (`Utc::now()`)
//! for the `allocated_at_utc` audit stamp is allowed here.
