//! `ChargebackService` — orchestrates the chargeback dispute domain
//! (`crate::domain::payment::chargeback`) over the foundation engine. Records
//! `opened` (Group B) and the `won`/`lost` outcomes (Group C) in both variants:
//! it seeds / advances the `ledger_dispute` current-state row and posts the
//! variant's legs in one serializable transaction (via [`ChargebackSidecar`]).
//!
//! Sequence for one phase (mirrors
//! [`crate::infra::payment::settlement_return::SettlementReturnService`] plus a
//! dispute pre-read + the net cash-leg read):
//! 1. **dedup short-circuit** — a replayed phase returns the prior entry BEFORE
//!    the state-dependent transition guard (which would spuriously reject a
//!    replayed `opened`).
//! 2. **read the dispute** — out-of-txn, scoped. Drives the variant selection,
//!    the transition guard, and the out-of-order decision.
//! 3. **out-of-order** (`won`/`lost` with NO prior dispute row, §4.7) — durably
//!    ENQUEUE the request on `ledger_pending_event_queue` (`flow = CHARGEBACK`,
//!    `business_id = dispute_id:cycle:phase`) and return [`ChargebackOutcome::Queued`]
//!    (HTTP 202), NEVER a partial outcome and NEVER a synthesised `opened`.
//! 4. **variant + transition guard** — `opened` derives the variant from
//!    `funds_at_open`; `won`/`lost` read the recorded variant back from the row.
//! 5. **net cash-leg read** (`CASH_HOLD` only, Model N) — read the settlement and
//!    size the cash legs at `net = settled_minor − fee_minor` (the cash that
//!    actually entered `CASH_CLEARING`; the PSP fee went to `PSP_FEE_EXPENSE`).
//!    An `AR_RECLASS` dispute has no PSP fee / no cash leg, so `net` is moot (`0`).
//! 6. **`CHARGEBACK_ON_REFUNDED` pre-check** — a `lost` whose clawback cannot fit
//!    under the total money-out cap because the payment was already refunded
//!    routes to a minimal exception stub (logged + a distinct `DomainError`;
//!    the full exception queue is Slice 7 / VHP-1859).
//! 7. **build → overwrite header → bind chart → post** with [`ChargebackSidecar`]
//!    (the dispute-row write + the clawback counter bump + the in-txn
//!    `dispute.recorded` outbox publish, all atomic with the entry).
//! 8. **drain-on-`opened`** — when a FRESH `opened` commits, [`Self::record_phase`]
//!    drains the tenant's CHARGEBACK queue inline (mirrors settle's drain-on-settle)
//!    so a queued `won`/`lost` whose `opened` just landed posts immediately; the
//!    periodic [`crate::infra::jobs::queue_applier`] sweep is the backstop.
//!
//! There is NO payer gate (a dispute records a card-network / bank event and must
//! land even for a closed payer). Idempotent on
//! `(tenant, CHARGEBACK, "dispute_id:cycle:phase")`. Lives in `infra` (needs repo
//! + posting access); the domain builder it calls stays pure (dylint DE0301).
