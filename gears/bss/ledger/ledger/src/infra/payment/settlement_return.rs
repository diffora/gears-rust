//! `SettlementReturnService` — orchestrates the settlement-return domain
//! (`crate::domain::payment::settlement_return`) over the foundation engine. It
//! records a clawed-back receipt as the SYMMETRIC reverse of settle (Model N,
//! D1): `DR UNALLOCATED amount / CR CASH_CLEARING (amount − fee_share) / CR
//! PSP_FEE_EXPENSE fee_share`, decrementing BOTH the original payment's
//! `settled_minor` (by the gross) and `fee_minor` (by the proportional
//! `fee_share`) in the same serializable transaction (via
//! [`SettlementReturnSidecar`]), and publishing `settlement.returned` in-txn.
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::infra::payment::settle::SettlementService`] minus the
//! drain-on-settle hook (a return unblocks no queued allocation): read the
//! settlement + compute the proportional `fee_share` → build → overwrite header →
//! bind chart → resolve scale + post with the sidecar → emit metrics. The
//! `fee_share = fee_minor × amount / settled_minor` is computed against the
//! CURRENT remaining balances so repeated partial returns stay proportional.
//! There is NO payer gate (a return records money already moved and must land
//! even for a closed payer). Idempotent on `(tenant, SETTLEMENT_RETURN,
//! psp_return_id)` — a re-posted return replays the prior entry with no new
//! ledger effect. Lives in `infra` (needs repo + posting access); the domain
//! builder it calls stays pure (dylint DE0301).
