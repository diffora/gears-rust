//! `AllocationService` — the orchestrator that drives the pure allocation
//! domain (`crate::domain::payment::{precedence, allocation}`) through the
//! foundation engine (Pattern A apply). It records the **money-out** side of a
//! payment: a lump from the payer's unallocated pool is applied to their open
//! receivables oldest-first, draining the pool (`DR UNALLOCATED`) into AR
//! (`CR AR` per invoice).
//!
//! Sequence for one allocate:
//! 1. **gate on settlement** — the payment must be settled (the
//!    `payment_settlement` row exists) and its currency must match the request.
//! 2. **read candidates** — the payer's open AR invoices for the currency
//!    (oldest-first, read-only and uncapped; the size bound is enforced below on
//!    the invoices the split actually touches, default [`MAX_INVOICES_PER_ALLOCATION`]).
//! 3. **decide** — resolve the tenant's effective-dated precedence policy
//!    (`PaymentRepo::read_effective_policy`; oldest-first when none) and
//!    `precedence::select_split` splits the lump across them under it.
//! 4. **build** the balanced Pattern-A-apply entry
//!    (`allocation::build_allocation_entry`), **overwrite** its placeholder
//!    header, **bind** chart `account_id`s, and **post** with the
//!    [`AllocationSidecar`] (bumps `allocated_minor` under the per-payment cap
//!    CHECK, inserts the `payment_allocation` rows, bumps the refund counters) —
//!    all in one serializable transaction.
//! 5. **emit metrics** — `allocation` (outcome) + the payment-post duration.
//!
//! The per-payment money-out cap (`allocated_minor <= settled_minor`) is the
//! sidecar's serializable backstop — an over-cap surfaces as
//! [`DomainError::MoneyOutCapExceeded`]. Idempotent on
//! `(tenant, PAYMENT_ALLOCATE, allocation_id)`: a replay of the same
//! `allocation_id` returns the prior entry with no duplicate rows. Lives in
//! `infra` (not `domain`) because it needs repo + posting access; the domain
//! modules it calls stay pure (dylint DE0301).
