//! `SettlementService` — the orchestrator that drives the pure settlement
//! domain (`crate::domain::payment::settlement`) through the foundation engine
//! (Pattern A). It records the **money-in** side of a payment: a settled
//! receipt lands in the payer's unallocated pool (`CR UNALLOCATED` for the
//! gross), the net cash hits clearing (`DR CASH_CLEARING`), and the processor
//! fee — when any — is expensed (`DR PSP_FEE_EXPENSE`). It does NOT move AR;
//! allocation (`AllocationService`) drains the pool into receivables later.
//!
//! It ties the pieces together for one settle post (mirrors the
//! invoice-post orchestrator's shape):
//! 1. **build** the balanced Pattern-A entry
//!    (`domain::payment::settlement::build_settlement_entry`).
//! 2. **overwrite header** — the pure builder emits placeholder header fields;
//!    the orchestrator stamps the real `period_id` (derived from the effective
//!    date), `effective_at` (a real date for the `None` case), the actor (from
//!    the security context), and a fresh `correlation_id`.
//! 3. **bind** each line's real chart `account_id` from the provisioned chart of
//!    accounts (the pure builder emits a nil placeholder).
//! 4. **resolve scale** per line and **post** via [`PostingService`], threading
//!    the [`SettlementSidecar`] so the `payment_settlement` counter row is seeded
//!    in the same serializable transaction (or rolled back with the entry).
//! 5. **emit metrics** — `payment_settle` (outcome) + the payment-post duration
//!    on every attempt.
//!
//! There is NO payer gate (unlike the invoice-post path): a settlement records
//! money already received and must land even for a closed payer. Lives in
//! `infra` (not `domain`) because it needs repo + posting access; the domain
//! module it calls stays pure (dylint DE0301).
