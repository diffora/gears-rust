//! `CreditApplicationService` — the orchestrator that drives the pure
//! reusable-credit (wallet) domain (`crate::domain::payment::credit`) through the
//! foundation engine. It moves money in and out of a tenant's reusable-credit
//! wallet (architecture §5.2) and is the credit counterpart to
//! [`crate::infra::payment::allocate::AllocationService`] — same deps, same
//! header/chart/post plumbing, two flows instead of one.
//!
//! - **grant** ([`grant_credit`](CreditApplicationService::grant_credit)) — parks
//!   unallocated pool cash into the wallet: **DR `UNALLOCATED`** / **CR
//!   `REUSABLE_CREDIT`**. Capped at the payer's live unallocated pool
//!   ([`PaymentRepo::read_unallocated`]) — a grant of more than the pool holds is
//!   rejected with [`DomainError::GrantExceedsUnallocated`] before any post (the
//!   pool can't fund credit it doesn't have).
//! - **apply** ([`apply_credit`](CreditApplicationService::apply_credit)) — spends
//!   the wallet against open receivables: **N×DR `REUSABLE_CREDIT`** (one per drawn
//!   sub-grain) / **M×CR `AR`** (one per receivable). Two caps bound it, each read
//!   from live ledger state: the receivable side is validated against the payer's
//!   open AR candidates ([`validate_credit_targets`] ⇒
//!   [`DomainError::CreditExceedsOpenAr`]), and the wallet side is planned against
//!   the payer's spendable sub-grains oldest-grant-first ([`plan_wallet_debit`] ⇒
//!   [`DomainError::CreditExceedsWallet`]). The drawn total always equals the
//!   target total, so the entry balances by construction.
//!
//! Sequence for one flow:
//! 1. **read the cap state** — the unallocated pool (grant) or the open AR
//!    candidates + spendable wallet sub-grains (apply).
//! 2. **decide / validate** — for apply, validate the caller's targets against the
//!    open candidates and plan the wallet draw-down for their total; grant has no
//!    split to decide (it is a single pool→wallet move).
//! 3. **build** the balanced entry ([`build_grant_entry`] / [`build_apply_entry`]),
//!    **overwrite** its placeholder header, **bind** chart `account_id`s, and
//!    **post**.
//! 4. **emit metrics** — `credit_application` (outcome) + the payment-post
//!    duration under [`PostFlow::CreditApply`].
//!
//! **No sidecar, no settlement gate.** Unlike allocate, credit is *wallet-sourced*,
//! not *payment-sourced*: there is no per-payment money-out cap to enforce in-txn,
//! so no [`PostSidecar`] is threaded (`None` is passed to the engine). The wallet
//! balance is itself a projector grain — the reusable-credit sub-balance cache the
//! engine maintains from the posted lines — so there is no counter table to bump
//! and no settlement row to gate on. Idempotent on `(tenant, CREDIT_APPLY,
//! credit_application_id)`: a replay of the same `credit_application_id` returns the
//! prior entry with no new ledger effect (both grant and apply share the
//! `CREDIT_APPLY` source doc type — see the domain module). Lives in `infra` (not
//! `domain`) because it needs repo + posting access; the domain module it calls
//! stays pure (dylint DE0301).
