//! Axum handlers + router for the ledger's refund (money-OUT) REST surface
//! (Slice 3, Phase 2, design §4.4 / §5 / §7, Group G). Three operations under
//! `/bss-ledger/v1`, tenant-scoped WITHOUT a tenant in the path (the vhp-core
//! convention, matching the adjustment / payment / dispute surfaces): the writes
//! carry `tenant_id` in the **body**, the by-id read takes the refund id in the
//! path + the owning seller `tenant_id` in the query.
//!
//! - `POST /refunds` — record one PSP refund phase (the money-out side that
//!   unwinds a settled receipt). Idempotent on `(psp_refund_id, phase)`: a re-post
//!   replays (`200`), a fresh post is `201`. A refund whose cash crosses the
//!   tenant's D2 threshold routes to dual-control (`409 DUAL_CONTROL_REQUIRED`). A
//!   refund whose origin payment has not landed is QUARANTINED
//!   (`202` + `refund-quarantined` body token), NEVER posted (design §4.4 / PRD
//!   L668) — distinct from queue-and-apply.
//! - `POST /refund-with-credit-note` — post a refund AND its paired S3 credit note
//!   ATOMICALLY in ONE transaction as two linked entries (K-3): both commit or
//!   neither, so AR is never overstated between them. `201` fresh / `200` replay /
//!   `409` over D2.
//! - `GET /refunds/{refund_id}` — read a recorded refund + its clearing state. The
//!   surrogate PK is `(tenant_id, refund_id)`, so the owning seller `tenant_id` is
//!   required in the query. `404` when no refund with that id exists (or it is
//!   outside the caller's subtree — no existence leak).
//!
//! All three authorize under `(entry, post)` / `(entry, read)` — the SAME
//! data-plane actions the credit/debit-note + invoice-post writes use (a refund
//! posts a balanced journal entry into the seller's ledger; the by-id read draws
//! from the `entry` ledger's `refund` record). This mirrors the Phase-1 notes
//! decision (`adjustments.rs`): a refund is not a separate authz resource, it
//! posts through the same `PostingService`. The `RefundHandler` is a concrete
//! orchestrator (not behind `LedgerClientV1`) that re-gates nothing internally, so
//! the handler-layer PEP gate is the authority and threads the compiled scope into
//! the post (the SQL-level BOLA filter), exactly as `adjustments::post_credit_note`.
//!
//! The routes register through `OperationBuilder` so `/openapi.json` lists each
//! operation with its declared request / response schemas. Mirrors
//! [`crate::api::rest::adjustments::router`].
