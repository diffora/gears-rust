//! Axum handlers + router for the ledger's adjustment (credit-note / debit-note /
//! exposure) REST surface (Slice 3, design §4.2 / §4.3 / §4.7 / §5, Group E).
//! Three operations under `/bss-ledger/v1`, tenant-scoped WITHOUT a tenant in the
//! path (the vhp-core convention, matching the payment / dispute / recognition
//! surfaces): the writes carry `tenant_id` in the **body**, the exposure read
//! takes the invoice id in the path + the owning seller `tenant_id` in the query.
//!
//! - `POST /credit-notes` — post a compensating credit note against a posted
//!   invoice (DR `CONTRA_REVENUE`/`GOODWILL` + per-stream DR `CONTRACT_LIABILITY` +
//!   DR `TAX_PAYABLE`; CR `AR` capped at open AR + CR `REUSABLE_CREDIT` remainder).
//!   Idempotent on `credit_note_id`: a re-post replays (`200`), a fresh post is
//!   `201`. Rejected `CREDIT_NOTE_SPLIT_AMBIGUOUS` (indeterminable split) /
//!   `CREDIT_NOTE_EXCEEDS_HEADROOM` (over the invoice's headroom cap).
//! - `POST /debit-notes` — post an additional charge (DIRECT split: DR `AR` /
//!   CR `REVENUE` / CR `CONTRACT_LIABILITY` / CR `TAX_PAYABLE`), building the
//!   releasing schedule when it defers (D4) and **raising** the invoice's
//!   headroom. Idempotent on `debit_note_id`: re-post `200`, fresh `201`. A closed
//!   payer is rejected `PAYER_CLOSED`.
//! - `GET /invoices/{invoice_id}/exposure` — read the invoice's remaining
//!   credit-note headroom (`original + debit − credit`) + its true remaining open
//!   AR. `404` when no note has touched the invoice yet (no exposure row) or it is
//!   outside the caller's subtree (no existence leak).
//! - `POST /manual-adjustments` — post a GOVERNED manual adjustment (design §4.6):
//!   the ledger's escape hatch for corrections the typed flows do not cover
//!   (rounding residue, suspense / cash-clearing clean-up). The body's `action`
//!   selects a code-owned allow-list of account classes; `REVENUE` /
//!   `CONTRACT_LIABILITY` are off-limits and an unpaired `CONTRA_REVENUE` leg is
//!   rejected as an attempted write-off (`400 MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT_NOT_ALLOWED`,
//!   additionally captured + paged on the write-off path). A `reason_code` is
//!   mandatory; the preparer is the AUTHENTICATED subject (never the body). A
//!   governed adjustment whose gross (`Σ DR`) crosses the tenant's D2 threshold
//!   routes to dual-control (`409 DUAL_CONTROL_REQUIRED`, via the canonical-error
//!   ladder). Idempotent on `adjustment_id`: re-post `200`, fresh `201`.
//!
//! The three writes (credit note / debit note / manual adjustment) authorize under
//! `(entry, post)` — the SAME data-plane post action the recognition-run /
//! invoice-post writes use (each posts a balanced journal entry into the seller's
//! ledger); the exposure read under `(entry, read)` — the SAME action the balance /
//! schedule reads use (the exposure counters are drawn down from the `entry`
//! ledger). The credit / debit / manual handlers are concrete orchestrators (not
//! behind `LedgerClientV1`), so the `ApiState` carries them directly
//! (`Arc<CreditNoteHandler>` / `Arc<DebitNoteHandler>` /
//! `Arc<ManualAdjustmentHandler>`) + the `AdjustmentRepo` for the exposure read —
//! they re-gate nothing internally, so the handler-layer PEP gate is the authority
//! and threads the compiled scope into the post (the SQL-level BOLA filter),
//! mirroring `journal_entries::post_invoice`. The manual handler is the GATED
//! instance (dual-control over D2 → 409); the executor's un-gated replay handler is
//! a SEPARATE instance wired in `module`.
//!
//! The routes register through `OperationBuilder` so `/openapi.json` lists each
//! operation with its declared request / response schemas. Mirrors
//! [`crate::api::rest::recognition::router`].
//!
//! (Events / metrics emit — `billing.ledger.credit_note.posted`,
//! `ledger_credit_note_total{,_blocked}` / `ledger_debit_note_total` — are wired in
//! Group F; this Group-E surface emits none yet.)
