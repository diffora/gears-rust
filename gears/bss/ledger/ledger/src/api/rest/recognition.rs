//! Axum handler + router for the ledger's recognition-run REST surface
//! (architecture §5, the ASC 606 S6 release). One write operation under
//! `/bss-ledger/v1`, tenant-scoped WITHOUT a tenant in the path (the vhp-core
//! convention, matching the payment / dispute surfaces): the `tenant_id` is in
//! the **body**.
//!
//! - `POST /recognition-runs` — trigger a recognition run for one fiscal period
//!   (release the period's due `PENDING` segments). The `(recognition, write)` PEP gate
//!   authorizes it against the body's `tenant_id` (a run posts `DR CL / CR
//!   Revenue` journal entries). Idempotent on the run-trigger `run_id` (`None` ⇒
//!   the ledger mints one): a replay returns the prior run reference (200)
//!   without re-running. When every due segment released in period order the run
//!   renders `200` (the run reference + the release tally); when a due segment's
//!   lower-period predecessor was not yet `DONE` the segment is parked `QUEUED`
//!   and the run renders **202** `recognition-period-queued` (a success/queued
//!   token, NOT a rejection — §4.6 ordering).
//!
//! The route registers through `OperationBuilder` so `/openapi.json` lists the
//! operation with its declared request / response schemas. Mirrors the
//! `record_dispute_phase` handler in [`crate::api::rest::disputes`].
//!
