//! Allocation-entry builder (architecture §5.2, **Pattern A apply**). Turns a
//! decided split of the unallocated pool into a balanced [`PostEntry`] that
//! drains the pool into the receivables it pays:
//!
//! - **DR `UNALLOCATED`** — one line for the sum of the splits (the amount leaving
//!   the pool).
//! - **CR `AR`** — one line per split, each carrying its `invoice_id` (the
//!   receivable that share pays down).
//!
//! `Σ DR (= Σ splits) == Σ CR (= Σ splits)` exactly — pure `i64`, summed via
//! `i128`. The split amounts come from
//! [`crate::domain::payment::precedence::oldest_first`]. Lines carry a placeholder
//! nil `account_id` (bound by the `crate::infra` orchestrator from
//! `(account_class, currency)` before posting) and placeholder header fields it
//! likewise overwrites (`period_id`, `posted_by_actor_id`, `correlation_id`, and
//! — when `effective_at` is `None` — `effective_at`).
