//! Chargeback (dispute) entry builder (architecture §4.5, design §2 / §3). A
//! dispute moves through `opened → {won, lost, partial}` phases; the LEDGER
//! chooses the **variant** at `opened` from the request's `funds_at_open` fact
//! (card rails withheld the cash ⇒ `CASH_HOLD`; invoice/ACH did not move it ⇒
//! `AR_RECLASS`) and the `won`/`lost` outcomes branch on the recorded variant.
//!
//! Scope (Groups B + C): this builder handles `opened`, `won`, and `lost`, in
//! both variants (`partial` is behind a flag — still rejected). The legs, pinned
//! from architecture §4.5 / design §3.
//!
//! **Model N (cash legs are net-of-fee).** A `CASH_HOLD` dispute's cash legs are
//! sized at `net = settled_minor − fee_minor`, NOT the gross `disputed`. `settle`
//! posts `DR CASH_CLEARING (net) · DR PSP_FEE_EXPENSE (fee) · CR UNALLOCATED
//! (gross)`, so `CASH_CLEARING` only ever holds **net** — sizing a cash leg at
//! gross would underflow it by exactly the fee. The PSP fee is finalised at
//! `settle` (in `PSP_FEE_EXPENSE`) and is never disputed; the seller eats it on a
//! loss. `disputed_amount_minor` is the **gross** claim (what the buyer paid / the
//! bank reverses) and sizes the AR-reclass legs + the dispute row, never the cash
//! legs. The orchestrator reads the settlement pre-build and threads `net` in
//! (the builder stays pure — it does no IO; it only sizes legs on the number it
//! is handed). Worked example (gross 100, fee 3, net 97):
//! ```text
//! settle: DR CASH_CLEARING 97 · DR PSP_FEE_EXPENSE 3 · CR UNALLOCATED 100
//! opened: DR DISPUTE_HOLD 97  · CR CASH_CLEARING 97
//! won:    DR CASH_CLEARING 97 · CR DISPUTE_HOLD 97
//! lost:   DR DISPUTE_LOSS 97  · CR DISPUTE_HOLD 97   (+ fee 3 already expensed = 100)
//! ```
//!
//! **`opened`** (Group B):
//! - **`CASH_HOLD`** — move the settled cash into a hold:
//!   `DR DISPUTE_HOLD (net) / CR CASH_CLEARING (net)`. Balanced; touches no AR.
//! - **`AR_RECLASS`** — reclass the disputed receivable `ACTIVE → DISPUTED` at
//!   the `(payer, invoice)` grain, AR-class-neutral: two AR lines for the SAME
//!   `(payer, invoice)` — `DR AR (ar_status = DISPUTED)` + `CR AR (ar_status =
//!   ACTIVE)`, each `disputed` — that net ZERO on `ar_invoice_balance.balance_minor`
//!   while the Group-A projector routes the signed `DISPUTED` delta into
//!   `disputed_minor` (+D). No PSP fee on invoice/ACH ⇒ gross = net = receivable.
//!
//! **`won`** (Group C — the seller's favour, no clawback):
//! - **`AR_RECLASS`** — reverse the opened reclass `DISPUTED → ACTIVE`:
//!   `DR AR (ar_status = ACTIVE)` + `CR AR (ar_status = DISPUTED)`, each
//!   `disputed`. Nets ZERO on `balance_minor`, `−D` on `disputed_minor`. No cash.
//! - **`CASH_HOLD`** — release the hold back to clearing:
//!   `DR CASH_CLEARING (net) / CR DISPUTE_HOLD (net)` (the reverse of the opened
//!   cash leg). The withheld net cash is the seller's again (the fee stays lost).
//!
//! **`lost`** (Group C — against the seller, the clawback):
//! - **`CASH_HOLD`** — the cash was already withheld at `opened` (it left
//!   `CASH_CLEARING` into `DISPUTE_HOLD` then), so the loss is recognised out of
//!   the hold: `DR DISPUTE_LOSS_EXPENSE (net) / CR DISPUTE_HOLD (net)` (release
//!   the hold, book the forfeiture). `clawed_back_minor += net`. `CASH_CLEARING`
//!   is NOT touched — the funds left clearing at open. The total loss is `net`
//!   (dispute-loss) + the fee already expensed at settle = gross = the buyer
//!   refund.
//! - **`AR_RECLASS`** — a write-off. The receivable was never collected (funds
//!   `not_moved`), so a lost dispute writes it off to loss:
//!   `DR DISPUTE_LOSS_EXPENSE (disputed) / CR AR (ar_status = DISPUTED)
//!   (disputed)`. The lone `CR AR DISPUTED` nets `−D` on BOTH `balance_minor` and
//!   `disputed_minor` (the projector routes the signed DISPUTED delta onto both),
//!   so no extra balance leg is needed. No cash leg, `clawed_back_minor`
//!   unchanged (nothing was ever collected to claw back).
//!
//! `partial` is NOT built here (behind a flag); the builder returns
//! [`DomainError::InvalidDisputeTransition`] for it.
//!
//! `source_doc_type = CHARGEBACK`; `source_business_id = "dispute_id:cycle:phase"`
//! (the `snake_case` composite idempotency key). Like the settlement / settlement-
//! return builders this stays pure (dylint DE0301): each line carries a nil
//! placeholder `account_id` + placeholder header fields the `crate::infra`
//! orchestrator overwrites before posting.
