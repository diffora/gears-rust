//! Allocation precedence policies. Given a lump of cash and the open invoices it
//! may pay, a policy decides — purely, with no money math beyond `min` — how much
//! each invoice receives.
//!
//! Every policy is *sequential fill*, not proportional: order the candidates (an
//! optional `hint` jumps one to the front), give each `min(remaining, open)` until
//! the lump is exhausted. Any leftover (`lump - Σ given`) is implicit — it stays
//! in the unallocated pool and is NOT returned. Policies differ ONLY in the order
//! they walk the candidates; the fill itself is shared. Two orders exist today:
//! [`oldest_first`] (`original_posted_at` ascending) and [`highest_amount_first`]
//! (`open_minor` descending), both stable and total so the same inputs always
//! split identically. [`select_split`] dispatches on a [`PrecedenceStrategy`].
