//! Settlement-return entry builder (architecture §4.2). Reverses a settled
//! receipt SYMMETRICALLY (Model N, D1) — the mirror image of the settle entry,
//! which under Model N split the gross into NET cash + the PSP fee:
//!
//! - **DR `UNALLOCATED`** (`amount`) — remove the returned gross from the pool.
//! - **CR `CASH_CLEARING`** (`amount − fee_share`) — the NET cash leaves clearing
//!   (clearing only ever held net; the fee never entered it).
//! - **CR `PSP_FEE_EXPENSE`** (`fee_share`) — reverse the proportional slice of the
//!   fee that was expensed at settle. **Omitted entirely when `fee_share == 0`**
//!   (never a zero line — matches how settle omits its fee leg).
//!
//! `Σ DR == Σ CR == amount_minor` exactly (`amount = (amount − fee_share) +
//! fee_share`). A full return (`amount = gross`, `fee_share = fee`) is the exact
//! mirror of settle. Mirrors the settlement builder's shape: each line carries a
//! placeholder nil `account_id` (the `crate::infra` orchestrator binds the real
//! chart row before posting) and placeholder header fields it likewise overwrites
//! (`period_id`, `posted_by_actor_id`, `correlation_id`, and — when `effective_at`
//! is `None` — `effective_at`).
//!
//! The builder stays PURE: it sizes the legs on the `fee_share` the orchestrator
//! hands it (computed proportionally against the CURRENT remaining balances so
//! repeated partial returns stay proportional) — it does NO IO and reads no
//! settlement row.
//!
//! Scope (Phase 4, Group D): the happy-path clawback-from-pool. One edge is
//! tracked as a follow-up (not built here):
//! - **over-allocated** — a return that would push `allocated_minor >
//!   settled_minor` must route to the exception queue rather than auto-post.
//!
//! The §4.5 documented-loss-on-negative-cash substitution is GONE (Model N
//! removed it): the symmetric reverse no longer over-credits `CASH_CLEARING` by
//! the fee. A genuine pool/cash underflow stays on the engine's guarded
//! no-negative CHECK (reject), and the `settled_minor` cap CHECK rejects an
//! over-allocated return (surfaced as
//! [`DomainError::SettlementReturnOverAllocated`]) — neither auto-posts a wrong
//! entry.
