//! Settlement-entry builder (architecture §5.2, **Pattern A**). Turns a settled
//! payment into a balanced [`PostEntry`] that lands the cash in the unallocated
//! pool:
//!
//! - **DR `CASH_CLEARING`** — the net cash received (`gross - fee`).
//! - **DR `PSP_FEE_EXPENSE`** — the processor fee (`fee`); omitted when `fee == 0`
//!   (no zero line).
//! - **CR `UNALLOCATED`** — the gross (`gross`); the whole receipt parks in the
//!   pool, drained later by an allocation entry.
//!
//! `Σ DR (= net + fee = gross) == Σ CR (= gross)` exactly — pure `i64`, summed via
//! `i128` to dodge an intermediate overflow. The emitted lines carry a placeholder
//! nil `account_id` (the `crate::infra` orchestrator binds the real chart row from
//! `(account_class, currency)` before posting) and placeholder header fields it
//! likewise overwrites (`period_id`, `posted_by_actor_id`, `correlation_id`, and
//! — when `effective_at` is `None` — `effective_at`).
