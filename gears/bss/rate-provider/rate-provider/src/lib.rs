#![cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, feature(coverage_attribute))]
//! `bss-rate-provider` — the core FX rate-provider gear.
//!
//! Discovers the registered source plugins (`bss-rate-provider-ecb-plugin`,
//! `bss-rate-provider-http-json-plugin`, …), orders them by `priority`, and
//! composes them with ordered fallback
//! ([`domain::composite::CompositeRateProvider`]). It re-registers that composite
//! as a `PluginV1` instance the ledger discovers (a scoped
//! [`bss_ledger_sdk::RateProviderV1`] keyed by its GTS instance id), so a
//! provider outage never touches the posting path — see `docs/DESIGN.md`.
