//! Runs the whole corpus against a conformance subject.
//!
//! There is no per-case filter on purpose. The only way to decline work is to
//! omit a family from `supported_families`, which is recorded and is never
//! green — so a subject cannot quietly skip the family it finds inconvenient.
//!
//! Two suites, because the corpus asks two questions of two different subjects:
//! [`run_evaluation_suite`] drives a [`CorpusEvaluator`] over the evaluation
//! cases, and [`run_publish_suite`] drives a [`PublishValidator`] over the
//! publish cases. Both live here rather than with their subjects: the runner is
//! corpus machinery, and a subject that ran its own cases would be free to
//! choose which ones.
