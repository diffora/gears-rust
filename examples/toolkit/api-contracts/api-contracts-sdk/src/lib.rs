// changes go into a new major version; v1 above stays untouched.
//
// Note on deprecation: ADR-0007 §4 has vN's traits marked `#[deprecated]` with a
// sunset date once vN+1 ships. That is deliberately NOT done here — this crate is
// a *fixture* whose own server, consumer, and tests implement v1 on purpose to
// demonstrate the two versions running side by side, so deprecating v1 would only
// bury the example in `allow(deprecated)`. A real SDK shipping v2 should mark the
// v1 base and projection deprecated and record the sunset date.

// is gated on the same feature; pulling the SDK with REST-only support
// must not require the gRPC dependency closure.
